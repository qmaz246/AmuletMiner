897,17,an essay on the material and spiritual universe
898,17,""
899,17,"it is with humility really unassumed -–it is with a sentiment even of awe -–that i pen the opening sentence of this work, for of all conceivable subjects i approach the reader with the most solemn -–the most comprehensive -–the most difficult -–the most august,"
900,17,""
901,17,what terms shall i find sufficiently simple in their sublimity -- sufficiently sublime in their simplicity -–for the mere enunciation of my theme?
902,17,""
903,17,"i design to speak of the physical, metaphysical and mathematical -- of the material and spiritual universe,–of its essence, its origin, its creation, its present condition and its destiny, i shall be so rash, moreover, as to challange the conclusions, and thus, in effect, to question the sagacity, of many of the greatest and most justly reverenced of men,"
904,17,""
905,17,"in the beginning, let me as distinctly as possible announce -–not the theorem which i hope to demonstrate -–for, whatever the mathematicians may assert, there is, in this world at least, no such thing as demonstration -–but the ruling idea which, throughout this volume, i shall be continually endeavoring to suggest,"
906,17,""
907,17,"my general proposition, then, is this, -–in the original unity of the first thing lies the secondary cause of all things, with the germ of their inevitable annihilation,"
908,17,""
909,17,"in illustration of this idea, i propose to take such a survey of the universe that the mind may be able really to receive and to perceive an individual impression,"
910,17,""
911,17,"he who from the top of aetna casts his eyes leisurely around, is affected chiefly by the extent and diversity of the scene, only by a rapid whirling on his heel could he hope to comprehend the panorama in the sublimity of its oneness, but as, on the summit of aetna, no man has thought of whirling on his heel, so no man has ever taken into his brain the full uniqueness of the prospect; and so, again, whatever considerations lie involved in this uniqueness, have as yet no practical existence for mankind,"
912,17,""
913,17,"i do not know a treatise in which a survey of the universe -- using the word in its most comprehensive and only legitimate acceptation -–is taken at all, -–and it may be as well here to mention that by the term ""universe,"" wherever employed without qualification in this essay, i mean to designate the utmost conceivable expanse of space, with all things, spiritual and material, that can he imagined to exist within the compass of that expanse, in speaking of what is ordinarily implied by the expression, ""universe,"" i shall take a phrase of limitation -–""the universe of stars,"" why this distinction is considered necessary, will be seen in the sequel,"
914,17,""
915,17,"but even of treatises on the really limited, although always assumed as the un limited, universe of stars, i know none in which a survey, even of this limited universe, is so taken as to warrant deductions from its individuality, the nearest approach to such a work is made in the ""cosmos"" of alexander von humboldt, he presents the subject, however, not in its individuality but in its generality, his theme, in its last result, is the law of each portion of the merely physical universe, as this law is related to the laws of every other portion of this merely physical universe, his design is simply synoeretical, in a word, he discusses the universality of material relation, and discloses to the eye of philosophy whatever inferences have hitherto lain hidden behind this universality, but however admirable be the succinctness with which he has treated each particular point of his topic, the mere multiplicity of these points occasions, necessarily, an amount of detail, and thus an involution of idea, which preclude all individuality of impression,"
916,17,""
917,17,"it seems to me that, in aiming at this latter effect, and, through it, at the consequences -–the conclusions -–the suggestions -–the speculations -–or, if nothing better offer itself, the mere guesses which may result from it -–we require something like a mental gyration on the heel, we need so rapid a revolution of all things about the central point of sight that, while the minutiae vanish altogether, even the more conspicuous objects become blended into one, among the vanishing minutiae, in a survey of this kind, would be all exclusively terrestrial matters, the earth would be considered in its planetary relations alone, a man, in this view, becomes mankind; mankind a member of the cosmical family of intelligences,"
918,17,""
919,17,"and now, before proceeding to our subject proper, let me beg the reader's attention to an extract or two from a somewhat remarkable letter, which appears to have been found corked in a bottle and floating on the mare tenebrarum–an ocean well described by the nubian geographer, ptolemy hephestion, but little frequented in modern days unless by the transcendentalists and some other divers for crotchets, the date of this letter, i confess, surprises me even more particularly than its contents; for it seems to have been written in the year two thousand eight hundred and forty-eight, as for the passages i am about to transcribe, they, i fancy, will speak for themselves,"
920,17,""
921,17,"""do you know, my dear friend,"" says the writer, addressing, no doubt, a contemporary -–""do you know that it is scarcely more than eight or nine hundred years ago since the metaphysicians first consented to relieve the people of the singular fancy that there exist but two practicable roads to truth? believe it if you can! it appears, however, that long, long ago, in the night of time, there lived a turkish philosopher called aries and surnamed tottle,"" [here, possibly, the letter-writer means aristotle; the best names are wretchedly corrupted in two or three thousand years,] ""the fame of this great man depended mainly upon his demonstration that sneezing is a natural provision, by means of which over-profound thinkers are enabled to expel superfluous ideas through the nose; but he obtained a scarcely less valuable celebrity as the founder, or at all events as the principal propagator, of what was termed the de ductive or a priori philosophy, he started with what he maintained to be axioms, or self-evident truths, -–and the now well-understood fact that no truths are self -evident, really does not make in the slightest degree against his speculations, -–it was sufficient for his purpose that the truths in question were evident at all, from axioms he proceeded, logically, to results, his most illustrious disciples were one tuclid, a geometrician,"" [meaning euclid] ""and one kant, a dutchman, the originator of that species of transcendentalism which, with the change merely of a c for a k, now bears his peculiar name,"
922,17,""
923,17,"""well, aries tottle flourished supreme, until the advent of one hog, surnamed 'the ettrick shepherd,' who preached an entirely different system, which he called the a posteriori or in ductive, his plan referred altogether to sensation, he proceeded by observing, analyzing, and classifying facts -–instantiae naturae, as they were somewhat affectedly called -–and arranging them into general laws, in a word, while the mode of aries rested on noumena, that of hog depended on phenomena; and so great was the admiration excited by this latter system that, at its first introduction, aries fell into general disrepute, finally, however, he recovered ground, and was permitted to divide the empire of philosophy with his more modern rival, -–the savans contenting themselves with proscribing all other competitors, past, present, and to come; putting an end to all controversy on the topic by the promulgation of a median law, to the effect that the aristotelian and baconian roads are, and of right ought to be, the sole possible avenues to knowledge, -–'baconian,' you must know, my dear friend,"" adds the letter-writer at this point, ""was an adjective invented as equivalent to hog-ian, and at the same time more dignified and euphonious,"
924,17,""
925,17,"""now i do assure you most positively"" -–proceeds the epistle -–""that i represent these matters fairly; and you can easily understand how restrictions so absurd on their very face must have operated, in those days, to retard the progress of true science, which makes its most important advances -–as all history will show -–by seemingly intuitive leaps, these ancient ideas confined investigation to crawling; and i need not suggest to you that crawling, among varieties of locomotion, is a very capital thing of its kind; -–but because the tortoise is sure of foot, for this reason must we clip the wings of the eagles? for many centuries, so great was the infatuation, about hog especially, that a virtual stop was put to all thinking, properly so called, no man dared utter a truth for which he felt himself indebted to his soul alone, it mattered not whether the truth was even demonstrably such; for the dogmatizing philosophers of that epoch regarded only the road by which it professed to have been attained, the end, with them, was a point of no moment, whatever, -–'the means!' they vociferated -–'let us look at the means!' -- and if, on scrutiny of the means, it was found to come neither under the category hog, nor under the category aries which means ram, why then the savans went no farther, but, calling the thinker a fool and branding him a 'theorist,' would never, thenceforward, have any thing to do either with him or with his truths,"
926,17,""
927,17,"""now, my dear friend,"" continues the letter-writer, ""it cannot be maintained that by the crawling system, exclusively adopted, men would arrive at the maximum amount of truth, even in any long series of ages; for the repression of imagination was an evil not to be counterbalanced even by absolute certainty in the snail processes, but their certainty was very far from absolute, the error of our progenitors was quite analogous with that of the wiseacre who fancies he must necessarily see an object the more distinctly, the more closely he holds it to his eyes, they blinded themselves, too, with the impalpable, titillating scotch snuff of detail; and thus the boasted facts of the hog-ites were by no means always facts -–a point of little importance but for the assumption that they always were, the vital taint, however, in baconianism -–its most lamentable fount of error -–lay in its tendency to throw power and consideration into the hands of merely perceptive men -–of those inter-tritonic minnows, the microscopical savans -–the diggers and pedlers of minute facts, for the most part in physical science -- facts all of which they retailed at the same price upon the highway; their value depending, it was supposed, simply upon the fact of their fact, without reference to their applicability or inapplicability in the development of those ultimate and only legitimate facts, called law,"
928,17,""
929,17,"""than the persons"" -–the letter goes on to say -–""than the persons thus suddenly elevated by the hog-ian philosophy into a station for which they were unfitted -–thus transferred from the sculleries into the parlors of science -–from its pantries into its pulpits -–than these individuals a more intolerant -–a more intolerable set of bigots and tyrants never existed on the face of the earth, their creed, their text and their sermon were, alike, the one word 'fact' -–but, for the most part, even of this one word, they knew not even the meaning, on those who ventured to disturb their facts with the view of putting them in order and to use, the disciples of hog had no mercy whatever, all attempts at generalization were met at once by the words 'theoretical,' 'theory,' 'theorist' -–all thought, to be brief, was very properly resented as a personal affront to themselves, cultivating the natural sciences to the exclusion of metaphysics, the mathematics, and logic, many of these bacon-engendered philosophers -–one-idead, one-sided and lame of a leg -–were more wretchedly helpless -–more miserably ignorant, in view of all the comprehensible objects of knowledge, than the veriest unlettered hind who proves that he knows something at least, in admitting that he knows absolutely nothing,"
930,17,""
931,17,"""nor had our forefathers any better right to talk about certainty, when pursuing, in blind confidence, the a priori path of axioms, or of the ram, at innumerable points this path was scarcely as straight as a ram's-horn, the simple truth is, that the aristotelians erected their castles upon a basis far less reliable than air; for no such things as axioms ever existed or can possibly exist at all, this they must have been very blind, indeed, not to see, or at least to suspect; for, even in their own day, many of their long-admitted 'axioms' had been abandoned, -–'ex nihilo nihil fit,' for example, and a 'thing cannot act where it is not,' and 'there cannot be antipodes,' and 'darkness cannot proceed from light,' these and numerous similar propositions formerly accepted, without hesitation, as axioms, or undeniable truths, were, even at the period of which i speak, seen to be altogether untenable, -–how absurd in these people, then, to persist in relying upon a basis, as immutable, whose mutability had become so repeatedly manifest!"
932,17,""
933,17,"""but, even through evidence afforded by themselves against themselves, it is easy to convict these a priori reasoners of the grossest unreason -–it is easy to show the futility -–the impalpability of their axioms in general, i have now lying before me"" -- it will be observed that we still proceed with the letter -–""i have now lying before me a book printed about a thousand years ago, pundit assures me that it is decidedly the cleverest ancient work on its topic, which is 'logic,' the author, who was much esteemed in his day, was one miller or mill; and we find it recorded of him, as a point of some importance, that he rode a mill-horse whom he called jeremy bentham, -–but let us glance at the volume itself!"
934,17,""
935,17,"""ah! -–'ability or inability to conceive,' says mr, mill very properly, 'is in no case to be received as a criterion of axiomatic truth,' now, that this is a palpable truism no one in his senses will deny, not to admit the proposition, is to insinuate a charge of variability in truth itself, whose very title is a synonym of the steadfast, if ability to conceive be taken as a criterion of truth, then a truth to david hume would very seldom be a truth to joe; and ninety-nine hundredths of what is undeniable in heaven would be demonstrable falsity upon earth, the proposition of mr, mill, then, is sustained, i will not grant it to be an axiom; and this merely because i am showing that no axioms exist; but, with a distinction which could not have been cavilled at even by mr, mill himself, i am ready to grant that, if an axiom there be, then the proposition of which we speak has the fullest right to be considered an axiom -–that no more absolute axiom is -–and, consequently, that any subsequent proposition which shall conflict with this one primarily advanced, must be either a falsity in itself -–that is to say no axiom -–or, if admitted axiomatic, must at once neutralize both itself and its predecessor,"

948,17,""
949,17,"this thesis admits a choice between two modes of discussion, -–we may as cend or des cend, beginning at our own point of view -–at the earth on which we stand -–we may pass to the other planets of our system -–thence to the sun -–thence to our system considered collectively -–and thence, through other systems, indefinitely outwards; or, commencing on high at some point as definite as we can make it or conceive it, we may come down to the habitation of man, usually -–that is to say, in ordinary essays on astronomy -–the first of these two modes is, with certain reservation, adopted, -–this for the obvious reason that astronomical facts, merely, and principles, being the object, that object is best fulfilled in stepping from the known because proximate, gradually onward to the point where all certitude becomes lost in the remote, for my present purpose, however, -–that of enabling the mind to take in, as if from afar and at one glance, a distant conception of the individual universe -–it is clear that a descent to small from great -–to the outskirts from the centre if we could establish a centre -–to the end from the beginning if we could fancy a beginning would be the preferable course, but for the difficulty, if not impossibility, of presenting, in this course, to the unastronomical, a picture at all comprehensible in regard to such considerations as are involved in quantity -–that is to say, in number, magnitude and distance,"
950,17,""
951,17,"now, distinctness -–intelligibility, at all points, is a primary feature in my general design, on important topics it is better to be a good deal prolix than even a very little obscure, but abstruseness is a quality appertaining to no subject per se, all are alike, in facility of comprehension, to him who approaches them by properly graduated steps, it is merely because a stepping-stone, here and there, is heedlessly left unsupplied in our road to the differential calculus, that this latter is not altogether as simple a thing as a sonnet by mr, solomon seesaw,"
952,17,""
953,17,"by way of admitting, then, no chance for misapprehension, i think it advisable to proceed as if even the more obvious facts of astronomy were unknown to the reader, in combining the two modes of discussion to which i have referred, i propose to avail myself of the advantages peculiar to each -–and very especially of the iteration in detail which will be unavoidable as a consequence of the plan, commencing with a descent, i shall reserve for the return upwards those indispensable considerations of quantity to which allusion has already been made,"
954,17,""
955,17,"let us begin, then, at once, with that merest of words, ""infinity,"" this, like ""god,"" ""spirit,"" and some other expressions of which the equivalents exist in all languages, is by no means the expression of an idea -–but of an effort at one, it stands for the possible attempt at an impossible conception, man needed a term by which to point out the direction of this effort -–the cloud behind which lay, forever invisible, the object of this attempt, a word, in fine, was demanded, by means of which one human being might put himself in relation at once with another human being and with a certain tendency of the human intellect, out of this demand arose the word, ""infinity;"" which is thus the representative but of the thought of a thought,"
956,17,""
957,17,"as regards that infinity now considered -–the infinity of space -–we often hear it said that ""its idea is admitted by the mind -–is acquiesced in -–is entertained -–on account of the greater difficulty which attends the conception of a limit,"" but this is merely one of those phrases by which even profound thinkers, time out of mind, have occasionally taken pleasure in deceiving themselves, the quibble lies concealed in the word ""difficulty,"" ""the mind,"" we are told, ""entertains the idea of limitless, through the greater difficulty which it finds in entertaining that of limited, space,"" now, were the proposition but fairly put, its absurdity would become transparent at once, clearly, there is no mere difficulty in the case, the assertion intended, if presented according to its intention and without sophistry, would run thus, -–""the mind admits the idea of limitless, through the greater impossibility of entertaining that of limited, space,"""
958,17,""
959,17,"it must be immediately seen that this is not a question of two statements between whose respective credibilities -–or of two arguments between whose respective validities -–the reason is called upon to decide, -–it is a matter of two conceptions, directly conflicting, and each avowedly impossible, one of which the intellect is supposed to be capable of entertaining, on account of the greater impossibility of entertaining the other, the choice is not made between two difficulties; -–it is merely fancied to be made between two impossibilities, now of the former, there are degrees, -–but of the latter, none, -–just as our impertinent letter-writer has already suggested, a task may be more or less difficult; but it is either possible or not possible, -–there are no gradations, it might be more difficult to overthrow the andes than an ant-hill; but it can be no more impossible to annihilate the matter of the one than the matter of the other, a man may jump ten feet with less difficulty than he can jump twenty, but the impossibility of his leaping to the moon is not a whit less than that of his leaping to the dog-star,"
960,17,""
961,17,"since all this is undeniable, since the choice of the mind is to be made between impossibilities of conception, since one impossibility cannot be greater than another, and since, thus, one cannot be preferred to another, the philosophers who not only maintain, on the grounds mentioned, man's idea of infinity but, on account of such supposititious idea, infinity itself -–are plainly engaged in demonstrating one impossible thing to be possible by showing how it is that some one other thing -–is impossible too, this, it will be said, is nonsense; and perhaps it is, -–indeed i think it very capital nonsense -–but forego all claim to it as nonsense of mine,"
962,17,""
963,17,"the readiest mode, however, of displaying the fallacy of the philosophical argument on this question, is by simply adverting to a fact respecting it which has been hitherto quite overlooked -–the fact that the argument alluded to both proves and disproves its own proposition, ""the mind is impelled,"" say the theologians and others, ""to admit a first cause, by the superior difficulty it experiences in conceiving cause beyond cause without end,"" the quibble, as before, lies in the word ""difficulty"" -–but here what is it employed to sustain? a first cause, and what is a first cause? an ultimate termination of causes, and what is an ultimate termination of causes? finity -–the finite, thus the one quibble, in two processes, by god knows how many philosophers, is made to support now finity and now infinity -–could it not be brought to support something besides? as for the quibblers -–they, at least, are insupportable, but -–to dismiss them, -–what they prove in the one case is the identical nothing which they demonstrate in the other,"
964,17,""
965,17,"of course, no one will suppose that i here contend for the absolute impossibility of that which we attempt to convey in the word ""infinity,"" my purpose is but to show the folly of endeavoring to prove infinity itself, or even our conception of it, by any such blundering ratiocination as that which is ordinarily employed,"
966,17,""
967,17,"nevertheless, as an individual, i may be permitted to say that i cannot conceive infinity, and am convinced that no human being can, a mind not thoroughly self-conscious -–not accustomed to the introspective analysis of its own operations -–will, it is true, often deceive itself by supposing that it has entertained the conception of which we speak, in the effort to entertain it, we proceed step beyond step -–we fancy point still beyond point; and so long as we continue the effort, it may be said, in fact, that we are tending to the formation of the idea designed; while the strength of the impression that we actually form or have formed it, is in the ratio of the period during which we keep up the mental endeavor, but it is in the act of discontinuing the endeavor -–of fulfilling as we think the idea -–of putting the finishing stroke as we suppose to the conception -–that we overthrow at once the whole fabric of our fancy by resting upon some one ultimate and therefore definite point, this fact, however, we fail to perceive, on account of the absolute coincidence, in time, between the settling down upon the ultimate point and the act of cessation in thinking, -–in attempting, on the other hand, to frame the idea of a limited space, we merely converse the processes which involve the impossibility,"
968,17,""
969,17,"we believe in a god, we may or may not believe in finite or in infinite space; but our belief, in such cases, is more properly designated as faith, and is a matter quite distinct from that belief proper -–from that intellectual belief -–which presupposes the mental conception,"
970,17,""
971,17,"the fact is, that, upon the enunciation of any one of that class of terms to which ""infinity"" belongs -–the class representing thoughts of thought -–he who has a right to say that he thinks at all, feels himself called upon, not to entertain a conception, but simply to direct his mental vision toward some given point, in the intellectual firmament, where lies a nebula never to be resolved, to solve it, indeed, he makes no effort; for with a rapid instinct he comprehends, not only the impossibility, but, as regards all human purposes, the inessentiality, of its solution, he perceives that the deity has not designed it to be solved, he sees, at once, that it lies out of the brain of man, and even how, if not exactly why, it lies out of it, there are people, i am aware, who, busying themselves in attempts at the unattainable, acquire very easily, by dint of the jargon they emit, among those thinkers-that-they-think with whom darkness and depth are synonymous, a kind of cuttle-fish reputation for profundity; but the finest quality of thought is its self-cognizance; and, with some little equivocation, it may be said that no fog of the mind can well be greater than that which, extending to the very boundaries of the mental domain, shuts out even these boundaries themselves from comprehension,"
972,17,""
973,17,"it will now be understood that, in using the phrase, ""infinity of space,"" i make no call upon the reader to entertain the impossible conception of an absolute infinity, i refer simply to the ""utmost conceivable expanse"" of space -–a shadowy and fluctuating domain, now shrinking, now swelling, in accordance with the vacillating energies of the imagination,"
974,17,""
975,17,"hitherto, the universe of stars has always been considered as coincident with the universe proper, as i have defined it in the commencement of this discourse, it has been always either directly or indirectly assumed -–at least since the dawn of intelligible astronomy -–that, were it possible for us to attain any given point in space, we should still find, on all sides of us, an interminable succession of stars, this was the untenable idea of pascal when making perhaps the most successful attempt ever made, at periphrasing the conception for which we struggle in the word ""universe,"" ""it is a sphere,"" he says, ""of which the centre is everywhere, the circumference, nowhere,"" but although this intended definition is, in fact, no definition of the universe of stars, we may accept it, with some mental reservation, as a definition rigorous enough for all practical purposes of the universe proper -–that is to say, of the universe of space, this latter, then, let us regard as ""a sphere of which the centre is everywhere, the circumference nowhere,"" in fact, while we find it impossible to fancy an end to space, we have no difficulty in picturing to ourselves any one of an infinity of beginnings,"
976,17,""
977,17,"as our starting point, then, let us adopt the godhead, of this godhead, in itself, he alone is not imbecile -–he alone is not impious who propounds -–nothing, ""nous ne connaissons rien,"" says the baron de bielfeld -–""nous ne connaissons rien de la nature ou de l'essence de dieu, -–pour savoir ce qu'il est, il faut etre dieu meme,"" -–""we know absolutely nothing of the nature or essence of god, -- in order to comprehend what he is, we should have to be god ourselves,"""
978,17,""
979,17,"""we should have to be god ourselves!"" -–with a phrase so startling as this yet ringing in my ears, i nevertheless venture to demand if this our present ignorance of the deity is an ignorance to which the soul is everlastingly condemned,"
980,17,""
981,17,"by him, however -–now, at least, the incomprehensible -–by him -- assuming him as spirit -–that is to say, as not matter -–a distinction which, for all intelligible purposes, will stand well instead of a definition -–by him, then, existing as spirit, let us content ourselves, to-night, with supposing to have been created, or made out of nothing, by dint of his volition -–at some point of space which we will take as a centre -–at some period into which we do not pretend to inquire, but at all events immensely remote -–by him, then again, let us suppose to have been created -–what? this is a vitally momentous epoch in our considerations, what is it that we are justified -–that alone we are justified in supposing to have been, primarily and solely, created?"
982,17,""
983,17,"we have attained a point where only intuition can aid us, -–but now let me recur to the idea which i have already suggested as that alone which we can properly entertain of intuition, it is but the conviction arising from those inductions or deductions of which the processes are so shadowy as to escape our consciousness, elude our reason, or defy our capacity of expression, with this understanding, i now assert -–that an intuition altogether irresistible, although inexpressible, forces me to the conclusion that what god originally created -–that that matter which, by dint of his volition, he first made from his spirit, or from nihility, could have been nothing but matter in its utmost conceivable state of -- what? -–of simplicity?"
984,17,""
985,17,"this will be found the sole absolute assumption of my discourse, i use the word ""assumption"" in its ordinary sense; yet i maintain that even this my primary proposition, is very, very far indeed, from being really a mere assumption, nothing was ever more certainly -–no human conclusion was ever, in fact, more regularly -–more rigorously de duced, -–but, alas! the processes lie out of the human analysis -–at all events are beyond the utterance of the human tongue,"
986,17,""
987,17,"let us now endeavor to conceive what matter must be, when, or if, in its absolute extreme of simplicity, here the reason flies at once to imparticularity -–to a particle -–to one particle -–a particle of one kind -–of one character -–of one nature -–of one size -–of one form -- a particle, therefore, ""without form and void"" -–a particle positively a particle at all points -–a particle absolutely unique, individual, undivided, and not indivisible only because he who created it, by dint of his will, can by an infinitely less energetic exercise of the same will, as a matter of course, divide it,"
988,17,""
989,17,"oneness, then, is all that i predicate of the originally created matter; but i propose to show that this oneness is a principle abundantly sufficient to account for the constitution, the existing phaenomena and the plainly inevitable annihilation of at least the material universe,"
990,17,""
991,17,"the willing into being the primordial particle, has completed the act, or more properly the conception, of creation, we now proceed to the ultimate purpose for which we are to suppose the particle created -- that is to say, the ultimate purpose so far as our considerations yet enable us to see it -–the constitution of the universe from it, the particle,"
992,17,""
993,17,"this constitution has been effected by forcing the originally and therefore normally one into the abnormal condition of many, an action of this character implies reaction, a diffusion from unity, under the conditions, involves a tendency to return into unity -–a tendency ineradicable until satisfied, but on these points i will speak more fully hereafter,"
994,17,""
995,17,"the assumption of absolute unity in the primordial particle includes that of infinite divisibility, let us conceive the particle, then, to be only not totally exhausted by diffusion into space, from the one particle, as a centre, let us suppose to be irradiated spherically -–in all directions -–to immeasurable but still to definite distances in the previously vacant space -–a certain inexpressibly great yet limited number of unimaginably yet not infinitely minute atoms,"
996,17,""
997,17,"now, of these atoms, thus diffused, or upon diffusion, what conditions are we permitted -–not to assume, but to infer, from consideration as well of their source as of the character of the design apparent in their diffusion? unity being their source, and difference from unity the character of the design manifested in their diffusion, we are warranted in supposing this character to be at least generally preserved throughout the design, and to form a portion of the design itself, -–that is to say, we shall be warranted in conceiving continual differences at all points from the uniquity and simplicity of the origin, but, for these reasons, shall we be justified in imagining the atoms heterogeneous, dissimilar, unequal, and inequidistant? more explicitly -–are we to consider no two atoms as, at their diffusion, of the same nature, or of the same form, or of the same size? -–and, after fulfilment of their diffusion into space, is absolute inequidistance, each from each, to be understood of all of them? in such arrangement, under such conditions, we most easily and immediately comprehend the subsequent most feasible carrying out to completion of any such design as that which i have suggested -–the design of variety out of unity -–diversity out of sameness -- heterogeneity out of homogeneity -–complexity out of simplicity -–in a word, the utmost possible multiplicity of relation out of the emphatically irrelative one, undoubtedly, therefore, we should be warranted in assuming all that has been mentioned, but for the reflection, first, that supererogation is not presumable of any divine act; and, secondly, that the object supposed in view, appears as feasible when some of the conditions in question are dispensed with, in the beginning, as when all are understood immediately to exist, i mean to say that some are involved in the rest, or so instantaneous a consequence of them as to make the distinction inappreciable, difference of size, for example, will at once be brought about through the tendency of one atom to a second, in preference to a third, on account of particular inequidistance; which is to be comprehended as particular inequidistances between centres of quantity, in neighboring atoms of different form -–a matter not at all interfering with the generally-equable distribution of the atoms, difference of kind, too, is easily conceived to be merely a result of differences in size and form, taken more or less conjointly, -–in fact, since the unity of the particle proper implies absolute homogeneity, we cannot imagine the atoms, at their diffusion, differing in kind, without imagining, at the same time, a special exercise of the divine will, at the emission of each atom, for the purpose of effecting, in each, a change of its essential nature, -–so fantastic an idea is the less to be indulged, as the object proposed is seen to be thoroughly attainable without such minute and elaborate interposition, we perceive, therefore, upon the whole, that it would be supererogatory, and consequently unphilosophical, to predicate of the atoms, in view of their purposes, any thing more than difference of form at their dispersion, with particular inequidistance after it -–all other differences arising at once out of these, in the very first processes of mass-constitution, -–we thus establish the universe on a purely geometrical basis, of course, it is by no means necessary to assume absolute difference, even of form, among the atoms irradiated -–any more than absolute particular inequidistance of each from each, we are required to conceive merely that no neighboring atoms are of similar form -–no atoms which can ever approximate, until their inevitable reunition at the end,"
998,17,""
999,17,"although the immediate and perpetual tendency of the disunited atoms to return into their normal unity, is implied, as i have said, in their abnormal diffusion; still it is clear that this tendency will be without consequence -–a tendency and no more -–until the diffusive energy, in ceasing to be exerted, shall leave it, the tendency, free to seek its satisfaction, the divine act, however, being considered as determinate, and discontinued on fulfilment of the diffusion, we understand, at once, a reaction -–in other words, a satisfiable tendency of the disunited atoms to return into one,"
1000,17,""
1001,17,"but the diffusive energy being withdrawn, and the reaction having commenced in furtherance of the ultimate design -–that of the utmost possible relation -–this design is now in danger of being frustrated, in detail, by reason of that very tendency to return which is to effect its accomplishment in general, multiplicity is the object; but there is nothing to prevent proximate atoms, from lapsing at once, through the now satisfiable tendency -–before the fulfilment of any ends proposed in multiplicity -–into absolute oneness among themselves, -–there is nothing to impede the aggregation of various unique masses, at various points of space, -- in other words, nothing to interfere with the accumulation of various masses, each absolutely one,"
1002,17,""
1003,17,"for the effectual and thorough completion of the general design, we thus see the necessity for a repulsion of limited capacity -–a separate something which, on withdrawal of the diffusive volition, shall at the same time allow the approach, and forbid the junction, of the atoms; suffering them infinitely to approximate, while denying them positive contact; in a word, having the power -–up to a certain epoch -–of preventing their coalition, but no ability to interfere with their coalescence in any respect or degree, the repulsion, already considered as so peculiarly limited in other regards, must be understood, let me repeat, as having power to prevent absolute coalition, only up to a certain epoch, unless we are to conceive that the appetite for unity among the atoms is doomed to be satisfied never; -–unless we are to conceive that what had a beginning is to have no end -–a conception which cannot really be entertained, however much we may talk or dream of entertaining it -- we are forced to conclude that the repulsive influence imagined, will, finally -–under pressure of the uni-tendency collectively applied, but, never and in no degree until, on fulfilment of the divine purposes, such collective application shall be naturally made -–yield to a force which, at that ultimate epoch, shall be the superior force precisely to the extent required, and thus permit the universal subsidence into the inevitable, because original and therefore normal, one, -–the conditions here to be reconciled are difficult indeed, -–we cannot even comprehend the possibility of their conciliation; -–nevertheless, the apparent impossibility is brilliantly suggestive,"
1004,17,""
1005,17,"that the repulsive something actually exists, we see, man neither employs, nor knows, a force sufficient to bring two atoms into contact, this is but the well-established proposition of the impenetrability of matter, all experiment proves -–all philosophy admits it, the design of the repulsion -–the necessity for its existence -–i have endeavored to show; but from all attempt at investigating its nature have religiously abstained; this on account of an intuitive conviction that the principle at issue is strictly spiritual -–lies in a recess impervious to our present understanding -- lies involved in a consideration of what now -–in our human state -–is not to be considered -–in a consideration of spirit in itself, i feel, in a word, that here the god has interposed, and here only, because here and here only the knot demanded the interposition of the god,"

1007,17,"in fact, while the tendency of the diffused atoms to return into unity, will be recognized, at once, as the principle of the newtonian gravity, what i have spoken of as a repulsive influence prescribing limits to the immediate satisfaction of the tendency, will be understood as that which we have been in the practice of designating now as heat, now as magnetism, now as electricity; displaying our ignorance of its awful character in the vacillation of the phraseology with which we endeavor to circumscribe it,"
1008,17,""
1009,17,"calling it, merely for the moment, electricity, we know that all experimental analysis of electricity has given, as an ultimate result, the principle, or seeming principle, heterogeneity, only where things differ is electricity apparent; and it is presumable that they never differ where it is not developed at least, if not apparent, now, this result is in the fullest keeping with that which i have reached unempirically, the design of the repulsive influence i have maintained to be that of preventing immediate unity among the diffused atoms; and these atoms are represented as different each from each, difference is their character -–their essentiality -–just as no-difference was the essentiality of their course, when we say, then, that an attempt to bring any two of these atoms together would induce an effort, on the part of the repulsive influence, to prevent the contact we may as well use the strictly convertible sentence that an attempt to bring together any two differences will result in a development of electricity, all existing bodies, of course, are composed of these atoms in proximate contact, and are therefore to be considered as mere assemblages of more or fewer differences; and the resistance made by the repulsive spirit, on bringing together any two such assemblages, would be in the ratio of the two sums of the differences in each, -–an expression which, when reduced, is equivalent to this, -–the amount of electricity developed on the approximation of two bodies, is proportional to the difference between the respective sums of the atoms of which the bodies are composed, that no two bodies are absolutely alike, is a simple corollary from all that has been here said, electricity, therefore, existing always, is developed whenever any bodies, but manifested only when bodies of appreciable difference, are brought into approximation,"
1010,17,""
1011,17,"to electricity -–so, for the present, continuing to call it -–we may not be wrong in referring the various physical appearances of light, heat and magnetism; but far less shall we be liable to err in attributing to this strictly spiritual principle the more important phaenomena of vitality, consciousness and thought, on this topic, however, i need pause here merely to suggest that these phaenomena, whether observed generally or in detail, seem to proceed at least in the ratio of the heterogeneous,"
1012,17,""
1013,17,"discarding now the two equivocal terms, ""gravitation"" and ""electricity,"" let us adopt the more definite expressions, ""attraction"" and ""repulsion,"" the former is the body; the latter the soul, the one is the material; the other the spiritual, principle of the universe, no other principles exist, all phaenomena are referable to one, or to the other, or to both combined, so rigorously is this the case -–so thoroughly demonstrable is it that attraction and repulsion are the sole properties through which we perceive the universe -–in other words, by which matter is manifested to mind -–that, for all merely argumentative purposes, we are fully justified in assuming that matter exists only as attraction and repulsion -–that attraction and repulsion are matter, -–there being no conceivable case in which we may not employ the term ""matter"" and the terms ""attraction"" and ""repulsion,"" taken together, as equivalent, and therefore convertible, expressions in logic,"
1014,17,""
1015,17,"i said, just now, that what i have described as the tendency of the diffused atoms to return into their original unity, would be understood as the principle of the newtonian law of gravity, and, in fact, there can be but little difficulty in such an understanding, if we look at the newtonian gravity in a merely general view, as a force impelling matter to seek matter; that is to say, when we pay no attention to the known modus operandi of the newtonian force, the general coincidence satisfies us; but, upon looking closely, we see, in detail, much that appears in coincident, and much in regard to which no coincidence, at least, is established, for example; the newtonian gravity, when we think of it in certain moods, does not seem to be a tendency to oneness at all, but rather a tendency of all bodies in all directions -–a phrase apparently expressive of a tendency to diffusion, here, then, is an in coincidence, again; when we reflect on the mathematical la0 governing the newtonian tendency, we see clearly that no coincidence has been made good, in respect of the modus operandi, at least, between gravitation as known to exist and that seemingly simple and direct tendency which i have assumed,"
1016,17,""
1017,17,"in fact, i have attained a point at which it will be advisable to strengthen my position by reversing my processes, so far, we have gone on a priori, from an abstract consideration of simplicity, as that quality most likely to have characterized the original action of god, let us now see whether the established facts of the newtonian gravitation may not afford us, a posteriori, some legitimate inductions,"
1018,17,""
1019,17,"what does the newtonian law declare? -–that all bodies attract each other with forces proportional to their quantities of matter and inversely proportional to the squares of their distances, purposely, i have here given, in the first place, the vulgar version of the law; and i confess that in this, as in most other vulgar versions of great truths, we find little of a suggestive character, let us now adopt a more philosophical phraseology, -–every atom, of every body, attracts every other atom, both of its own and of every other body, with a force which varies inversely as the squares of the distances between the attracting and attracted atom, -–here, indeed, a flood of suggestion bursts upon the mind,"
1020,17,""
1021,17,"but let us see distinctly what it was that newton proved -- according to the grossly irrational definitions of proof prescribed by the metaphysical schools, he was forced to content himself with showing how thoroughly the motions of an imaginary universe, composed of attracting and attracted atoms obedient to the law he announced, coincide with those of the actually existing universe so far as it comes under our observation, this was the amount of his demonstration -–that is to say, this was the amount of it, according to the conventional cant of the ""philosophies,"" his successes added proof multiplied by proof -–such proof as a sound intellect admits -–but the demonstration of the law itself, persist the metaphysicians, had not been strengthened in any degree, ""ocular, physical proof,"" however, of attraction, here upon earth, in accordance with the newtonian theory, was, at length, much to the satisfaction of some intellectual grovellers, afforded, this proof arose collaterally and incidentally as nearly all important truths have arisen out of an attempt to ascertain the mean density of the earth, in the famous maskelyne, cavendish and bailly experiments for this purpose, the attraction of the mass of a mountain was seen, felt, measured, and found to be mathematically consistent with the immortal theory of the british astronomer,"
1022,17,""
1023,17,"but in spite of this confirmation of that which needed none -–in spite of the so-called corroboration of the ""theory"" by the so-called ""ocular and physical proof"" -–in spite of the character of this corroboration -–the ideas which even really philosophical men cannot help imbibing of gravity -–and, especially, the ideas of it which ordinary men get and contentedly maintain, are seen to have been derived, for the most part, from a consideration of the principle as they find it developed -–merely in the planet upon which they stand,"
1024,17,""
1025,17,"now, to what does so partial a consideration tend -–to what species of error does it give rise? on the earth we see and feel, only that gravity impels all bodies towards the centre of the earth, no man in the common walks of life could be made to see or feel anything else -–could be made to perceive that anything, anywhere, has a perpetual, gravitating tendency in any other direction than to the centre of the earth; yet with an exception hereafter to be specified it is a fact that every earthly thing not to speak now of every heavenly thing has a tendency not only to the earth's centre but in every conceivable direction besides,"
1026,17,""
1027,17,"now, although the philosophic cannot be said to err with the vulgar in this matter, they nevertheless permit themselves to be influenced, without knowing it, by the sentiment of the vulgar idea, ""although the pagan fables are not believed,"" says bryant, in his very erudite ""mythology,"" ""yet we forget ourselves continually and make inferences from them as from existing realities,"" i mean to assert that the merely sensitive perception of gravity as we experience it on earth, beguiles mankind into the fancy of concentralization or especiality respecting it -–has been continually biasing towards this fancy even the mightiest intellects -–perpetually, although imperceptibly, leading them away from the real characteristics of the principle; thus preventing them, up to this date, from ever getting a glimpse of that vital truth which lies in a diametrically opposite direction -–behind the principle's essential characteristics -–those, not of concentralization or especiality -–but of universality and diffusion, this ""vital truth"" is unity as the source of the phaenomenon,"
1028,17,""
1029,17,"let me now repeat the definition of gravity, -–every atom, of every body, attracts every other atom, both of its own and of every other body, with a force which varies inversely as the squares of the distances of the attracting and attracted atom,"
1030,17,""
1031,17,"here let the reader pause with me, for a moment, in contemplation of the miraculous -–of the ineffable -–of the altogether unimaginable complexity of relation involved in the fact that each atom attracts every other atom -–involved merely in this fact of the attraction, without reference to the law or mode in which the attraction is manifested -–involved merely in the fact that each atom attracts every other atom at all, in a wilderness of atoms so numerous that those which go to the composition of a cannon-ball, exceed, probably, in mere point of number, all the stars which go to the constitution of the universe,"
1032,17,""
1033,17,"had we discovered, simply, that each atom tended to some one favorite point -–to some especially attractive atom -–we should still have fallan upon a discovery which, in itself, would have sufficed to overwhelm the mind, -–but what is it that we are actually called upon to comprehend? that each atom attracts -–sympathizes with the most delicate movements of every other atom, and with each and with all at the same time, and forever, and according to a determinate law of which the complexity, even considered by itself solely, is utterly beyond the grasp of the imagination of man, if i propose to ascertain the influence of one mote in a sunbeam upon its neighboring mote, i cannot accomplish my purpose without first counting and weighing all the atoms in the universe and defining the precise positions of all at one particular moment, if i venture to displace, by even the billionth part of an inch, the microscopical speck of dust which lies now upon the point of my finger, what is the character of that act upon which i have adventured? i have done a deed which shakes the moon in her path, which causes the sun to be no longer the sun, and which alters forever the destiny of the multitudinous myriads of stars that roll and glow in the majestic presence of their creator,"
1034,17,""
1035,17,"these ideas -–conceptions such as these -–unthought-like thoughts -- soul-reveries rather than conclusions or even considerations of the intellect, -–ideas, i repeat, such as these, are such as we can alone hope profitably to entertain in any effort at grasping the great principle, attraction,"
1036,17,""
1037,17,"but now, -–with such ideas -–with such a vision of the marvellous complexity of attraction fairly in his mind -–let any person competent of thought on such topics as these, set himself to the task of imagining a principle for the phaenomena observed -–a condition from which they sprang,"
1038,17,""
1039,17,"does not so evident a brotherhood among the atoms point to a common parentage? does not a sympathy so omniprevalent, so ineradicable, and so thoroughly irrespective, suggest a common paternity as its source? does not one extreme impel the reason to the other? does not the infinitude of division refer to the utterness of individuality? does not the entireness of the complex hint at the perfection of the simple? it is not that the atoms, as we see them, are divided or that they are complex in their relations -–but that they are inconceivably divided and unutterably complex, -–it is the extremeness of the conditions to which i now allude, rather than to the conditions themselves, in a word, not because the atoms were, at some remote epoch of time, even more than together -–is it not because originally, and therefore normally, they were one -–that now, in all circumstances -–at all points -–in all directions -–by all modes of approach -–in all relations and through all conditions -–they struggle back to this absolutely, this irrelatively, this unconditionally one?"
1040,17,""
1041,17,"some person may here demand, -–""why -–since it is to the one that the atoms struggle back -–do we not find and define attraction 'a merely general tendency to a centre?' -–why, in especial, do not your atoms -–the atoms which you describe as having been irradiated from a centre -–proceed at once, rectilinearly, back to the central point of their origin?"""
1042,17,""
1043,17,"i reply that they do; as will be distinctly shown; but that the cause of their so doing is quite irrespective of the centre as such, they all tend rectilinearly towards a centre, because of the sphereicity with which they have been irradiated into space, each atom, forming one of a generally uniform globe of atoms, finds more atoms in the direction of the centre, of course, than in any other, and in that direction, therefore, is impelled -–but is not thus impelled because the centre is the point of its origin, it is not to any point that the atoms are allied, it is not any locality, either in the concrete or in the abstract, to which i suppose them bound, nothing like location was conceived as their origin, their source lies in the principle, unity, this is their lost parent, this they seek always -–immediately -–in all directions -–wherever it is even partially to be found; thus appeasing, in some measure, the ineradicable tendency, while on the way to its absolute satisfaction in the end, it follows from all this, that any principle which shall be adequate to account for the la0 or modus operandi, of the attractive force in general, will account for this law in particular, -- that is to say, any principle which will show why the atoms should tend to their general centre of irradiation with forces inversely proportional to the squares of the distances, will be admitted as satisfactorily accounting, at the same time, for the tendency, according to the same law, of these atoms each to each, -–for the tendency to the centre is merely the tendency each to each, and not any tendency to a centre as such, -–thus it will be seen, also, that the establishment of my propositions would involve no necessity of modification in the terms of the newtonian definition of gravity, which declares that each atom attracts each other atom and so forth, and declares this merely; but always under the supposition that what i propose be, in the end, admitted it seems clear that some error might occasionally be avoided, in the future processes of science, were a more ample phraseology adopted, -–for instance, -- ""each atom tends to every other atom &c, with a force &c,, the general result being a tendency of all, with a similar force, to a general centre,"""

1045,17,"the reversal of our processes has thus brought us to an identical result; but, while in the one process intuition was the starting-point, in the other it was the goal, in commencing the former journey i could only say that, with an irresistable intuition, i felt simplicity to have been the characteristic of the original action of god, -–in ending the latter i can only declare that, with an irresistible intuition, i perceive unity to have been the source of the observed phaenomena of the newtonian gra"

1525,31,"   to mar the silence ev'n with lute,"
1526,31,"   at rest on ocean's brilliant dyes"
1527,31,"   an image of elysium lies,"
1528,31,"   seven pleiades entranced in heaven,"
1529,31,"   form in the deep another seven,"
1530,31,"   endymion nodding from above"
1531,31,"   sees in the sea a second love,"
1532,31,"   within the valleys dim and brown,"
1533,31,"   and on the spectral mountain's crown,"
1534,31,"   the wearied light is dying down,"
1535,31,"   and earth, and stars, and sea, and sky"
1536,31,"   are redolent of sleep, as i"
1537,31,"   am redolent of thee and thine"
1538,31,"   enthralling love, my adeline,"
1539,31,"   but list, o list,- so soft and low"
1540,31,"   thy lover's voice tonight shall flow,"
1541,31,"   that, scarce awake, thy soul shall deem"
1542,31,"   my words the music of a dream,"
1543,31,"   thus, while no single sound too rude"
1544,31,"   upon thy slumber shall intrude,"
1545,31,"   our thoughts, our souls- o god above!"
1546,31,"   in every deed shall mingle, love,"
1547,32,"i saw thee on thy bridal day -"
1548,32,"when a burning blush came o'er thee,"
1549,32,"though happiness around thee lay,"
1550,32,"the world all love before thee,"
1551,32,""
1552,32,"and in thine eye a kindling light"

1555,32,"of loveliness could see,"
1556,32,""
1557,32,"that blush, perhaps, was maiden shame -"
1558,32,"as such it well may pass -"
1559,32,"though its glow hath raised a fiercer flame"
1560,32,"in the breast of him, alas!"
1561,32,""
1562,32,"who saw thee on that bridal day,"
1563,32,"when that deep blush would come o'er thee,"

1565,32,"the world all love before thee,"
1566,33,"science! true daughter of old time thou art!"
1567,33,"  who alterest all things with thy peering eyes,"
1568,33,"why preyest thou thus upon the poet's heart,"
1569,33,"  vulture, whose wings are dull realities?"
1570,33,"how should he love thee? or how deem thee wise,"
1571,33,"  who wouldst not leave him in his wandering"
1572,33,"to seek for treasure in the jewelled skies,"
1573,33,"  albeit he soared with an undaunted wing?"
1574,33,"hast thou not dragged diana from her car?"
1575,33,"  and driven the hamadryad from the wood"
1576,33,"to seek a shelter in some happier star?"
1577,33,"  hast thou not torn the naiad from her flood,"
1578,33,"the elfin from the green grass, and from me"

1581,34,"       that have a double life, which thus is made"
1582,34,"     a type of that twin entity which springs"
1583,34,"       from matter and light, evinced in solid and shade,"
1584,34,"     there is a two-fold silence- sea and shore-"

1625,36,"     but their red orbs, without beam,"
1626,36,"     to thy weariness shall seem"
1627,36,"     as a burning and a fever"

1641,37,"how often we forget all time, when lone"
1642,37,"   admiring nature's universal throne;"

1649,37,"   in secret communing held- as he with it,"
1650,37,"   in daylight, and in beauty from his birth,"
1651,37,"   whose fervid, flickering torch of life was lit"
1652,37,"   from the sun and stars, whence he had drawn forth"
1653,37,"   a passionate light- such for his spirit was fit-"
1654,37,"   and yet that spirit knew not, in the hour"
1655,37,"   of its own fervor what had o'er it power,"

1659,37,"   perhaps it may be that my mind is wrought"
1660,37,"   to a fever by the moonbeam that hangs o'er,"
1661,37,"   but i will half believe that wild light fraught"
1662,37,"   with more of sovereignty than ancient lore"
1663,37,"   hath ever told- or is it of a thought"
1664,37,"   the unembodied essence, and no more,"
1665,37,"   that with a quickening spell doth o'er us pass"
1666,37,   as dew of the night-time o'er the summer grass?
1667,37,""
1668,37,                      iii
1669,37,""

1672,37,"   will start, which lately slept in apathy?"
1673,37,"   and yet it need not be- that object hid"
1674,37,"   from us in life- but common- which doth lie"
1675,37,"   each hour before us- but then only, bid"
1676,37,"   with a strange sound, as of a harp-string broken,"
1677,37,   to awake us- 'tis a symbol and a token
1678,37,""
1679,37,                      iv
1680,37,""
1681,37,"   of what in other worlds shall be- and given"
1682,37,"   in beauty by our god, to those alone"
1683,37,"   who otherwise would fall from life and heaven"
1684,37,"   drawn by their heart's passion, and that tone,"
1685,37,"   that high tone of the spirit which hath striven,"
1686,37,"   tho' not with faith- with godliness- whose throne"
1687,37,"   with desperate energy 't hath beaten down;"
1688,37,"   wearing its own deep feeling as a crown,"
1689,38,kind solace in a dying hour!
1690,38,"       such, father, is not now my theme-"
1691,38,     i will not madly deem that power
1692,38,         of earth may shrive me of the sin
1693,38,         unearthly pride hath revell'd in-
1694,38,"       i have no time to dote or dream,"
1695,38,     you call it hope- that fire of fire!
1696,38,"     it is but agony of desire,"
1697,38,     if i can hope- oh god! i can-
1698,38,       its fount is holier- more divine-
1699,38,"     i would not call thee fool, old man,"
1700,38,"       but such is not a gift of thine,"
1701,38,     know thou the secret of a spirit
1702,38,"       bow'd from its wild pride into shame,"
1703,38,     o yearning heart! i did inherit
1704,38,"       thy withering portion with the fame,"
1705,38,     the searing glory which hath shone
1706,38,"     amid the jewels of my throne,"
1707,38,     halo of hell! and with a pain
1708,38,     not hell shall make me fear again-
1709,38,"     o craving heart, for the lost flowers"
1710,38,     and sunshine of my summer hours!
1711,38,"     the undying voice of that dead time,"
1712,38,"     with its interminable chime,"
1713,38,"     rings, in the spirit of a spell,"
1714,38,"     upon thy emptiness- a knell,"
1715,38,"     i have not always been as now,"
1716,38,     the fever'd diadem on my brow
1717,38,       i claim'd and won usurpingly-
1718,38,     hath not the same fierce heirdom given
1719,38,       rome to the caesar- this to me?
1720,38,"         the heritage of a kingly mind,"
1721,38,     and a proud spirit which hath striven
1722,38,"         triumphantly with human kind,"
1723,38,"     on mountain soil i first drew life,"
1724,38,       the mists of the taglay have shed
1725,38,"       nightly their dews upon my head,"
1726,38,"     and, i believe, the winged strife"
1727,38,     and tumult of the headlong air
1728,38,"     have nestled in my very hair,"
1729,38,     so late from heaven- that dew- it fell
1730,38,       mid dreams of an unholy night
1731,38,"     upon me with the touch of hell,"
1732,38,       while the red flashing of the light
1733,38,"     from clouds that hung, like banners, o'er,"
1734,38,       appeared to my half-closing eye
1735,38,"       the pageantry of monarchy,"
1736,38,     and the deep trumpet-thunder's roar
1737,38,"       came hurriedly upon me, telling"
1738,38,"         of human battle, where my voice,"
1739,38,"     my own voice, silly child!- was swelling"
1740,38,"         o! how my spirit would rejoice,"
1741,38,     and leap within me at the cry
1742,38,     the battle-cry of victory!
1743,38,     the rain came down upon my head
1744,38,       unshelter'd- and the heavy wind
1745,38,"       rendered me mad and deaf and blind,"
1746,38,"     it was but man, i thought, who shed"
1747,38,"       laurels upon me, and the rush-"
1748,38,     the torrent of the chilly air
1749,38,       gurgled within my ear the crush
1750,38,     of empires- with the captive's prayer-
1751,38,     the hum of suitors- and the tone
1752,38,"     of flattery 'round a sovereign's throne,"
1753,38,"     my passions, from that hapless hour,"
1754,38,       usurp'd a tyranny which men
1755,38,"     have deem'd, since i have reach'd to power,"
1756,38,"         my innate nature- be it so,"
1757,38,"       but father, there liv'd one who, then,"
1758,38,     then- in my boyhood- when their fire
1759,38,"         burn'd with a still intenser glow,"
1760,38,"     for passion must, with youth, expire"
1761,38,       e'en then who knew this iron heart
1762,38,"       in woman's weakness had a part,"
1763,38,     i have no words- alas!- to tell
1764,38,     the loveliness of loving well!
1765,38,     nor would i now attempt to trace
1766,38,     the more than beauty of a face
1767,38,"     whose lineaments, upon my mind,"
1768,38,"     are- shadows on th' unstable wind,"
1769,38,     thus i remember having dwelt
1770,38,"       some page of early lore upon,"
1771,38,"     with loitering eye, till i have felt"
1772,38,     the letters- with their meaning- melt
1773,38,"       to fantasies- with none,"
1774,38,"     o, she was worthy of all love!"
1775,38,       love- as in infancy was mine-
1776,38,     'twas such as angel minds above
1777,38,       might envy; her young heart the shrine
1778,38,     on which my every hope and thought
1779,38,"       were incense- then a goodly gift,"
1780,38,         for they were childish and upright-
1781,38,"     pure- as her young example taught,"
1782,38,"       why did i leave it, and, adrift,"
1783,38,"         trust to the fire within, for light?"
1784,38,"     we grew in age- and love- together,"
1785,38,"       roaming the forest, and the wild;"
1786,38,     my breast her shield in wintry weather-
1787,38,"       and when the friendly sunshine smil'd,"
1788,38,"     and she would mark the opening skies,"
1789,38,"     i saw no heaven- but in her eyes,"
1790,38,"     young love's first lesson is- the heart,"
1791,38,"       for 'mid that sunshine, and those smiles,"
1792,38,"     when, from our little cares apart,"
1793,38,"       and laughing at her girlish wiles,"
1794,38,"     i'd throw me on her throbbing breast,"
1795,38,       and pour my spirit out in tears-
1796,38,     there was no need to speak the rest-
1797,38,       no need to quiet any fears
1798,38,"     of her- who ask'd no reason why,"
1799,38,     but turn'd on me her quiet eye!
1800,38,     yet more than worthy of the love
1801,38,"     my spirit struggled with, and strove,"
1802,38,"     when, on the mountain peak, alone,"
1803,38,     ambition lent it a new tone-
1804,38,"     i had no being- but in thee,"
1805,38,"       the world, and all it did contain"
1806,38,     in the earth- the air- the sea-
1807,38,       its joy- its little lot of pain
1808,38,"     that was new pleasure- the ideal,"
1809,38,       dim vanities of dreams by night-
1810,38,     and dimmer nothings which were real-
1811,38,       shadows- and a more shadowy light!
1812,38,"     parted upon their misty wings,"
1813,38,"       and, so, confusedly, became"
1814,38,"       thine image, and- a name- a name!"
1815,38,"     two separate- yet most intimate things,"
1816,38,     i was ambitious- have you known
1817,38,"       the passion, father? you have not,"
1818,38,"     a cottager, i mark'd a throne"
1819,38,"     of half the world as all my own,"
1820,38,       and murmur'd at such lowly lot-
1821,38,"     but, just like any other dream,"
1822,38,       upon the vapour of the dew
1823,38,"     my own had past, did not the beam"
1824,38,       of beauty which did while it thro'
1825,38,     the minute- the hour- the day- oppress
1826,38,"     my mind with double loveliness,"
1827,38,     we walk'd together on the crown
1828,38,     of a high mountain which look'd down
1829,38,     afar from its proud natural towers
1830,38,"       of rock and forest, on the hills-"
1831,38,"     the dwindled hills! begirt with bowers,"
1832,38,"       and shouting with a thousand rills,"
1833,38,"     i spoke to her of power and pride,"
1834,38,       but mystically- in such guise
1835,38,     that she might deem it nought beside
1836,38,       the moment's converse; in her eyes
1837,38,"     i read, perhaps too carelessly-"
1838,38,       a mingled feeling with my own-
1839,38,"     the flush on her bright cheek, to me"
1840,38,       seem'd to become a queenly throne
1841,38,     too well that i should let it be
1842,38,"       light in the wilderness alone,"
1843,38,"     i wrapp'd myself in grandeur then,"
1844,38,       and donn'd a visionary crown-
1845,38,         yet it was not that fantasy
1846,38,         had thrown her mantle over me-
1847,38,"     but that, among the rabble- men,"
1848,38,       lion ambition is chained down-
1849,38,     and crouches to a keeper's hand-
1850,38,     not so in deserts where the grand-
1851,38,     the wild- the terrible conspire
1852,38,"     with their own breath to fan his fire,"
1853,38,     look 'round thee now on samarcand!
1854,38,       is not she queen of earth? her pride
1855,38,     above all cities? in her hand
1856,38,       their destinies? in all beside
1857,38,     of glory which the world hath known
1858,38,     stands she not nobly and alone?
1859,38,     falling- her veriest stepping-stone
1860,38,     shall form the pedestal of a throne-
1861,38,     and who her sovereign? timour- he
1862,38,       whom the astonished people saw
1863,38,     striding o'er empires haughtily
1864,38,       a diadem'd outlaw!
1865,38,"     o, human love! thou spirit given"
1866,38,"     on earth, of all we hope in heaven!"
1867,38,     which fall'st into the soul like rain
1868,38,"     upon the siroc-wither'd plain,"
1869,38,"     and, failing in thy power to bless,"
1870,38,     but leav'st the heart a wilderness!
1871,38,     idea! which bindest life around
1872,38,"     with music of so strange a sound,"
1873,38,     and beauty of so wild a birth-
1874,38,"     farewell! for i have won the earth,"
1875,38,"     when hope, the eagle that tower'd, could see"
1876,38,"       no cliff beyond him in the sky,"
1877,38,     his pinions were bent droopingly-
1878,38,"       and homeward turn'd his soften'd eye,"
1879,38,"     'twas sunset, when the sun will part"
1880,38,     there comes a sullenness of heart
1881,38,     to him who still would look upon
1882,38,"     the glory of the summer sun,"
1883,38,"     that soul will hate the ev'ning mist,"
1884,38,"     so often lovely, and will list"
1885,38,     to the sound of the coming darkness known
1886,38,     to those whose spirits hearken as one
1887,38,"     who, in a dream of night, would fly"
1888,38,"     but cannot from a danger nigh,"
1889,38,     what tho' the moon- the white moon
1890,38,"     shed all the splendour of her noon,"
1891,38,"     her smile is chilly, and her beam,"
1892,38,"     in that time of dreariness, will seem"
1893,38,     so like you gather in your breath
1894,38,"     a portrait taken after death,"
1895,38,     and boyhood is a summer sun
1896,38,     whose waning is the dreariest one-
1897,38,"     for all we live to know is known,"
1898,38,     and all we seek to keep hath flown-
1899,38,"     let life, then, as the day-flower, fall"
1900,38,"     with the noon-day beauty- which is all,"
1901,38,     i reach'd my home- my home no more
1902,38,"       for all had flown who made it so,"
1903,38,"     i pass'd from out its mossy door,"
1904,38,"       and, tho' my tread was soft and low,"
1905,38,     a voice came from the threshold stone
1906,38,     of one whom i had earlier known-
1907,38,"       o, i defy thee, hell, to show"
1908,38,"       on beds of fire that burn below,"
1909,38,"       a humbler heart- a deeper woe,"
1910,38,"     father, i firmly do believe-"
1911,38,"       i know- for death, who comes for me"
1912,38,"         from regions of the blest afar,"
1913,38,"     where there is nothing to deceive,"
1914,38,"         hath left his iron gate ajar,"
1915,38,       and rays of truth you cannot see
1916,38,       are flashing thro' eternity-
1917,38,     i do believe that eblis hath
1918,38,     a snare in every human path-
1919,38,"     else how, when in the holy grove"
1920,38,"     i wandered of the idol, love,"
1921,38,     who daily scents his snowy wings
1922,38,     with incense of burnt offerings
1923,38,"     from the most unpolluted things,"
1924,38,     whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven
1925,38,"     above with trellis'd rays from heaven,"
1926,38,     no mote may shun- no tiniest fly-
1927,38,     the lightning of his eagle eye-
1928,38,"     how was it that ambition crept,"
1929,38,"       unseen, amid the revels there,"
1930,38,"     till growing bold, he laughed and leapt"
1931,38,       in the tangles of love's very hair?

2175,42,"        that shift the scenery to and fro,"
2176,42,"      flapping from out their condor wings"
2177,42,        invisible woe!
2178,42,""
2179,42,"      that motley drama- oh, be sure"
2180,42,"        it shall not be forgot!"
2181,42,"      with its phantom chased for evermore,"
2182,42,"        by a crowd that seize it not,"
2183,42,"      through a circle that ever returneth in"
2184,42,"        to the self-same spot,"
2185,42,"      and much of madness, and more of sin,"
2186,42,"        and horror the soul of the plot,"
2187,42,""
2188,42,"      but see, amid the mimic rout"
2189,42,"        a crawling shape intrude!"
2190,42,"      a blood-red thing that writhes from out"
2191,42,"        the scenic solitude!"
2192,42,"      it writhes!- it writhes!- with mortal pangs"
2193,42,"        the mimes become its food,"
2194,42,"      and seraphs sob at vermin fangs"
2195,42,"        in human gore imbued,"
2196,42,""
2197,42,"      out- out are the lights- out all!"
2198,42,"        and, over each quivering form,"
2199,42,"      the curtain, a funeral pall,"
2200,42,"        comes down with the rush of a storm,"
2201,42,"      while the angels, all pallid and wan,"
2202,42,"        uprising, unveiling, affirm"
2203,42,"      that the play is the tragedy, ""man,"""
2204,42,"        and its hero the conqueror worm,"
2205,43,"the only king by right divine"
2206,43,"is ellen king, and were she mine"
2207,43,"i'd strive for liberty no more,"
2208,43,"but hug the glorious chains i wore,"
2209,43,""
2210,43,"her bosom is an ivory throne,"
2211,43,"where tyrant virtue reigns alone ;"
2212,43,"no subject vice dare interfere,"
2213,43,"to check the power that governs here,"
2214,43,""
2215,43,"o! would she deign to rule my fate,"
2216,43,"i'd worship kings and kingly state,"
2217,43,"and hold this maxim all life long,"
2218,43,"the king — my king — can do no wrong,"
2219,44,"'tis said that when"
2220,44,"the hands of men"
2221,44,"tamed this primeval wood,"
2222,44,"and hoary trees with groans of woe,"
2223,44,"like warriors by an unknown foe,"
2224,44,"were in their strength subdued,"
2225,44,"the virgin earth gave instant birth"
2226,44,"to springs that ne'er did flow"
2227,44,"that in the sun did rivulets run,"
2228,44,"and all around rare flowers did blow"
2229,44,"the wild rose pale perfumed the gale"
2230,44,"and the queenly lily adown the dale"
2231,44,"whom the sun and the dew"
2232,44,"and the winds did woo,"
2233,44,"with the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew,"
2234,44,""
2235,44,"so when in tears"
2236,44,"the love of years"
2237,44,"is wasted like the snow,"
2238,44,"and the fine fibrils of its life"
2239,44,"by the rude wrong of instant strife"
2240,44,"are broken at a blow"
2241,44,"within the heart"
2242,44,"do springs upstart"
2243,44,"of which it doth now know,"
2244,44,"and strange, sweet dreams,"
2245,44,"like silent streams"
2246,44,"that from new fountains overflow,"
2247,44,"with the earlier tide"
2248,44,"of rivers glide"
2249,44,"deep in the heart whose hope has died--"
2250,44,"quenching the fires its ashes hide,--"
2251,44,"its ashes, whence will spring and grow"
2252,44,"sweet flowers, ere long,"
2253,44,the rare and radiant flowers of song!
2254,45,"the happiest day- the happiest hour"
2255,45,"       my sear'd and blighted heart hath known,"
2256,45,"     the highest hope of pride and power,"
2257,45,"       i feel hath flown,"
2258,45,""
2259,45,"     of power! said i? yes! such i ween;"
2260,45,"       but they have vanish'd long, alas!"
2261,45,"     the visions of my youth have been-"
2262,45,"       but let them pass,"
2263,45,""
2264,45,"     and, pride, what have i now with thee?"
2265,45,"       another brow may even inherit"
2266,45,"     the venom thou hast pour'd on me"
2267,45,"       be still, my spirit!"
2268,45,""
2269,45,"     the happiest day- the happiest hour"
2270,45,"       mine eyes shall see- have ever seen,"
2271,45,"     the brightest glance of pride and power,"
2272,45,"       i feel- have been,"
2273,45,""
2274,45,"     but were that hope of pride and power"
2275,45,"       now offer'd with the pain"
2276,45,"     even then i felt- that brightest hour"
2277,45,"       i would not live again,"
2278,45,""
2279,45,"     for on its wing was dark alloy,"
2280,45,"       and, as it flutter'd- fell"
2281,45,"     an essence- powerful to destroy"
2282,45,"       a soul that knew it well,"
2283,46,"in the greenest of our valleys"
2284,46,"        by good angels tenanted,"
2285,46,"      once a fair and stately palace-"
2286,46,"        radiant palace- reared its head,"
2287,46,"      in the monarch thought's dominion-"
2288,46,"        it stood there!"
2289,46,"      never seraph spread a pinion"
2290,46,        over fabric half so fair!
2291,46,""
2292,46,"      banners yellow, glorious, golden,"
2293,46,"        on its roof did float and flow,"
2294,46,"      this- all this- was in the olden"
2295,46,"        time long ago,"
2296,46,"      and every gentle air that dallied,"
2297,46,"        in that sweet day,"
2298,46,"      along the ramparts plumed and pallid,"
2299,46,"        a winged odor went away,"
2300,46,""
2301,46,"      wanderers in that happy valley,"
2302,46,"        through two luminous windows, saw"
2303,46,"      spirits moving musically,"
2304,46,"        to a lute's well-tuned law,"
2305,46,"      round about a throne where, sitting"
2306,46,"        porphyrogene!"
2307,46,"      in state his glory well-befitting,"
2308,46,"        the ruler of the realm was seen,"
2309,46,""
2310,46,"      and all with pearl and ruby glowing"
2311,46,"        was the fair palace door,"
2312,46,"      through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,"
2313,46,"        and sparkling evermore,"
2314,46,"      a troop of echoes, whose sweet duty"
2315,46,"        was but to sing,"
2316,46,"      in voices of surpassing beauty,"
2317,46,"        the wit and wisdom of their king,"
2318,46,""
2319,46,"      but evil things, in robes of sorrow,"
2320,46,"        assailed the monarch's high estate,"
2321,46,"      ah, let us mourn!- for never morrow"
2322,46,"        shall dawn upon him desolate!"
2323,46,"      and round about his home the glory"
2324,46,"        that blushed and bloomed,"
2325,46,"      is but a dim-remembered story"
2326,46,"        of the old time entombed,"
2327,46,""
2328,46,"      and travellers, now, within that valley,"
2329,46,"        through the red-litten windows see"
2330,46,"      vast forms, that move fantastically"
2331,46,"        to a discordant melody,"
2332,46,"      while, like a ghastly rapid river,"
2333,46,"        through the pale door"
2334,46,"      a hideous throng rush out forever"
2335,46,"        and laugh- but smile no more,"
2336,47,"in spring of youth it was my lot"
2337,47,"      to haunt of the wide world a spot"
2338,47,"      the which i could not love the less-"
2339,47,"      so lovely was the loneliness"
2340,47,"      of a wild lake, with black rock bound,"
2341,47,"      and the tall pines that towered around,"
2342,47,""
2343,47,"      but when the night had thrown her pall"
2344,47,"      upon that spot, as upon all,"
2345,47,"      and the mystic wind went by"
2346,47,"      murmuring in melody-"
2347,47,"      then- ah then i would awake"
2348,47,"      to the terror of the lone lake,"
2349,47,""
2350,47,"      yet that terror was not fright,"
2351,47,"      but a tremulous delight-"
2352,47,"      a feeling not the jewelled mine"
2353,47,"      could teach or bribe me to define-"
2354,47,"      nor love- although the love were thine,"
2355,47,""
2356,47,"      death was in that poisonous wave,"
2357,47,"      and in its gulf a fitting grave"
2358,47,"      for him who thence could solace bring"
2359,47,"      to his lone imagining-"
2360,47,"      whose solitary soul could make"
2361,47,"      an eden of that dim lake,"
2362,48,"once upon a midnight dreary, while i pondered, weak and weary,"
2363,48," over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,"
2364,48,"   while i nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,"
2365,48,"  as of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door,"
2366,48," ""'tis some visitor,"" i muttered, ""tapping at my chamber door-"
2367,48,"               only this, and nothing more,"""
2368,48,""
2369,48,"   ah, distinctly i remember it was in the bleak december,"
2370,48," and each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor,"
2371,48,"   eagerly i wished the morrow;- vainly i had sought to borrow"
2372,48,"   from my books surcease of sorrow- sorrow for the lost lenore-"
2373,48," for the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore-"
2374,48,"               nameless here for evermore,"
2375,48,""
2376,48,"   and the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain"
2377,48," thrilled me- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;"
2378,48,"   so that now, to still the beating of my heart, i stood repeating,"
2379,48,"   ""'tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door-"
2380,48," some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;-"
2381,48,"               this it is, and nothing more,"""
2382,48,""
2383,48,"   presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,"
2384,48," ""sir,"" said i, ""or madam, truly your forgiveness i implore;"
2385,48,"   but the fact is i was napping, and so gently you came rapping,"
2386,48,"   and so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,"
2387,48," that i scarce was sure i heard you""- here i opened wide the door;-"
2388,48,"               darkness there, and nothing more,"
2389,48,""
2390,48,"   deep into that darkness peering, long i stood there wondering,"
2391,48,"       fearing,"
2392,48," doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;"
2393,48,"   but the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,"
2394,48,"   and the only word there spoken was the whispered word, ""lenore!"""
2395,48," this i whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, ""lenore!""-"
2396,48,"               merely this, and nothing more,"
2397,48,""
2398,48,"   back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,"
2399,48,"  soon again i heard a tapping somewhat louder than before,"
2400,48,"   ""surely,"" said i, ""surely that is something at my window lattice,"
2401,48,"   let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore-"
2402,48," let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;-"
2403,48,"               'tis the wind and nothing more,"""
2404,48,""
2405,48,"   open here i flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and"
2406,48,"       flutter,"
2407,48," in there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;"
2408,48,"   not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed"
2409,48,"       he;"
2410,48,"   but, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door-"
2411,48," perched upon a bust of pallas just above my chamber door-"
2412,48,"               perched, and sat, and nothing more,"
2413,48,""
2414,48,"  then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,"
2415,48," by the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,"
2416,48,"  ""though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,"" i said, ""art sure no"
2417,48,"       craven,"
2418,48,"  ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore-"
2419,48," tell me what thy lordly name is on the night's plutonian shore!"""
2420,48,"               quoth the raven, ""nevermore,"""
2421,48,""
2422,48,"   much i marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,"
2423,48," though its answer little meaning- little relevancy bore;"
2424,48,"   for we cannot help agreeing that no living human being"
2425,48,"   ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door-"
2426,48," bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,"
2427,48,"               with such name as ""nevermore,"""
2428,48,""
2429,48,"   but the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only"
2430,48," that one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour,"
2431,48,"   nothing further then he uttered- not a feather then he fluttered-"
2432,48,"   till i scarcely more than muttered, ""other friends have flown"
2433,48,"       before-"
2434,48," on the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before,"""
2435,48,"               then the bird said, ""nevermore,"""
2436,48,""
2437,48,"    startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,"
2438,48," ""doubtless,"" said i, ""what it utters is its only stock and store,"
2439,48,"    caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful disaster"
2440,48,"    followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore-"
2441,48," till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore"
2442,48,"               of 'never- nevermore',"""
2443,48,""
2444,48,"   but the raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,"
2445,48," straight i wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and"
2446,48,"       door;"
2447,48,"   then upon the velvet sinking, i betook myself to linking"
2448,48,"   fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore-"
2449,48," what this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore"
2450,48,"               meant in croaking ""nevermore,"""
2451,48,""
2452,48,"   this i sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing"
2453,48," to the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;"
2454,48,"   this and more i sat divining, with my head at ease reclining"
2455,48,"   on the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,"
2456,48," but whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er,"
2457,48,"               she shall press, ah, nevermore!"
2458,48,""
2459,48,"   then methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer"
2460,48," swung by seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor,"
2461,48,"   ""wretch,"" i cried, ""thy god hath lent thee- by these angels he"
2462,48,"       hath sent thee"
2463,48,"   respite- respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of lenore!"
2464,48," quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost lenore!"""
2465,48,"               quoth the raven, ""nevermore,"""
2466,48,""
2467,48,"   ""prophet!"" said i, ""thing of evil!- prophet still, if bird or"
2468,48,"       devil!-"
2469,48," whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,"
2470,48,"   desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted-"
2471,48,"   on this home by horror haunted- tell me truly, i implore-"
2472,48," is there- is there balm in gilead?- tell me- tell me, i implore!"""

2477,48," by that heaven that bends above us- by that god we both adore-"
2478,48,"   tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant aidenn,"
2479,48,"   it shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name lenore-"
2480,48," clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name lenore,"""
2481,48,"               quoth the raven, ""nevermore,"""
2482,48,""
2483,48,"   ""be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend,"" i shrieked,"
2484,48,"       upstarting-"
2485,48," ""get thee back into the tempest and the night's plutonian shore!"
2486,48,"   leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!"
2487,48,"   leave my loneliness unbroken!- quit the bust above my door!"
2488,48," take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my"
2489,48,"       door!"""
2490,48,"              quoth the raven, ""nevermore,"""
2491,48,""
2492,48,"   and the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting"
2493,48," on the pallid bust of pallas just above my chamber door;"
2494,48,"   and his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,"
2495,48,"   and the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the"
2496,48,"       floor;"
2497,48," and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor"
2498,48,               shall be lifted- nevermore!
2499,49,"at midnight, in the month of june,"
2500,49,"     i stand beneath the mystic moon,"
2501,49,"     an opiate vapor, dewy, dim,"
2502,49,"     exhales from out her golden rim,"
2503,49,"     and, softly dripping, drop by drop,"
2504,49,"     upon the quiet mountain top,"
2505,49,"     steals drowsily and musically"
2506,49,"     into the universal valley,"
2507,49,"     the rosemary nods upon the grave;"
2508,49,"     the lily lolls upon the wave;"
2509,49,"     wrapping the fog about its breast,"
2510,49,"     the ruin molders into rest;"
2511,49,"     looking like lethe, see! the lake"
2512,49,"     a conscious slumber seems to take,"
2513,49,"     and would not, for the world, awake,"
2514,49,"     all beauty sleeps!- and lo! where lies"
2515,49,"     irene, with her destinies!"
2516,49,""
2517,49,"     o, lady bright! can it be right-"
2518,49,"     this window open to the night?"
2519,49,"     the wanton airs, from the tree-top,"
2520,49,"     laughingly through the lattice drop-"
2521,49,"     the bodiless airs, a wizard rout,"
2522,49,"     flit through thy chamber in and out,"
2523,49,"     and wave the curtain canopy"
2524,49,"     so fitfully- so fearfully-"
2525,49,"     above the closed and fringed lid"
2526,49,"     'neath which thy slumb'ring soul lies hid,"
2527,49,"     that, o'er the floor and down the wall,"
2528,49,"     like ghosts the shadows rise and fall!"
2529,49,"     oh, lady dear, hast thou no fear?"
2530,49,"     why and what art thou dreaming here?"
2531,49,"     sure thou art come o'er far-off seas,"
2532,49,"     a wonder to these garden trees!"
2533,49,"     strange is thy pallor! strange thy dress,"
2534,49,"     strange, above all, thy length of tress,"
2535,49,     and this all solemn silentness!
2536,49,""
2537,49,"     the lady sleeps! oh, may her sleep,"
2538,49,"     which is enduring, so be deep!"
2539,49,"     heaven have her in its sacred keep!"
2540,49,"     this chamber changed for one more holy,"
2541,49,"     this bed for one more melancholy,"
2542,49,"     i pray to god that she may lie"
2543,49,"     for ever with unopened eye,"
2544,49,     while the pale sheeted ghosts go by!
2545,49,""
2546,49,"     my love, she sleeps! oh, may her sleep"
2547,49,"     as it is lasting, so be deep!"
2548,49,"     soft may the worms about her creep!"
2549,49,"     far in the forest, dim and old,"
2550,49,"     for her may some tall vault unfold-"
2551,49,"     some vault that oft has flung its black"
2552,49,"     and winged panels fluttering back,"
2553,49,"     triumphant, o'er the crested palls,"
2554,49,"     of her grand family funerals-"
2555,49,"     some sepulchre, remote, alone,"
2556,49,"     against whose portal she hath thrown,"
2557,49,"     in childhood, many an idle stone-"
2558,49,"     some tomb from out whose sounding door"
2559,49,"     she ne'er shall force an echo more,"
2560,49,"     thrilling to think, poor child of sin!"
2561,49,"     it was the dead who groaned within,"
2562,50,"once it smiled a silent dell"
2563,50,"      where the people did not dwell;"
2564,50,"      they had gone unto the wars,"
2565,50,"      trusting to the mild-eyed stars,"
2566,50,"      nightly, from their azure towers,"
2567,50,"      to keep watch above the flowers,"
2568,50,"      in the midst of which all day"
2569,50,"      the red sunlight lazily lay,"
2570,50,"      now each visitor shall confess"
2571,50,"      the sad valley's restlessness,"
2572,50,"      nothing there is motionless-"
2573,50,"      nothing save the airs that brood"
2574,50,"      over the magic solitude,"
2575,50,"      ah, by no wind are stirred those trees"
2576,50,"      that palpitate like the chill seas"
2577,50,"      around the misty hebrides!"
2578,50,"      ah, by no wind those clouds are driven"
2579,50,"      that rustle through the unquiet heaven"
2580,50,"      uneasily, from morn till even,"
2581,50,"      over the violets there that lie"
2582,50,"      in myriad types of the human eye-"
2583,50,"      over the lilies there that wave"
2584,50,"      and weep above a nameless grave!"
2585,50,"      they wave,- from out their fragrant tops"
2586,50,"      eternal dews come down in drops,"
2587,50,"      they weep,- from off their delicate stems"
2588,50,"      perennial tears descend in gems,"
2589,51,"i saw thee on thy bridal day-"
2590,51,"     when a burning blush came o'er thee,"
2591,51,"   though happiness around thee lay,"
2592,51,"     the world all love before thee,"
2593,51,""
2594,51,"   and in thine eye a kindling light"
2595,51,"     whatever it might be"
2596,51,"   was all on earth my aching sight"
2597,51,"     of loveliness could see,"
2598,51,""
2599,51,"   that blush, perhaps, was maiden shame-"
2600,51,"     as such it well may pass-"
2601,51,"   though its glow hath raised a fiercer flame"
2602,51,"     in the breast of him, alas!"
2603,51,""
2604,51,"   who saw thee on that bridal day,"
2605,51,"     when that deep blush would come o'er thee,"
2606,51,"   though happiness around thee lay;"
2607,51,"     the world all love before thee,"
2608,52,"the bowers whereat, in dreams, i see"
2609,52,"       the wantonest singing birds,"
2610,52,"     are lips- and all thy melody"
2611,52,       of lip-begotten words-
2612,52,""
2613,52,"     thine eyes, in heaven of heart enshrined,"
2614,52,"       then desolately fall,"
2615,52,"     o god! on my funereal mind"
2616,52,       like starlight on a pall-
2617,52,""
2618,52,"    thy heart- thy heart!- i wake and sigh,"
2619,52,"       and sleep to dream till day"
2620,52,"     of the truth that gold can never buy-"
2621,52,"       of the baubles that it may,"
2622,53,"sleep on, sleep on, another hour —"
2623,53,"i would not break so calm a sleep,"
2624,53,"to wake to sunshine and to show'r,"
2625,53,"to smile and weep,"
2626,53,""
2627,53,"sleep on, sleep on, like sculptured thing,"
2628,53,"majestic, beautiful art thou;"
2629,53,"sure seraph shields thee with his wing"
2630,53,and fans thy brow —
2631,53,""
2632,53,"we would not deem thee child of earth,"
2633,53,"for, o, angelic, is thy form!"
2634,53,"but, that in heav'n thou had'st thy birth,"
2635,53,where comes no storm
2636,53,""
2637,53,"to mar the bright, the perfect flow'r,"
2638,53,"but all is beautiful and still —"
2639,53,"and golden sands proclaim the hour"
2640,53,"which brings no ill,"
2641,53,""
2642,53,"sleep on, sleep on, some fairy dream"
2643,53,"perchance is woven in thy sleep —"
2644,53,"but, o, thy spirit, calm, serene,"
2645,53,"must wake to weep,"
2646,54,"not long ago, the writer of these lines,"
2647,54,"     in the mad pride of intellectuality,"
2648,54,"     maintained ""the power of words""- denied that ever"
2649,54,"     a thought arose within the human brain"
2650,54,"     beyond the utterance of the human tongue,"
2651,54,"     and now, as if in mockery of that boast,"
2652,54,"     two words- two foreign soft dissyllables-"
2653,54,"     italian tones, made only to be murmured"
2654,54,"     by angels dreaming in the moonlit ""dew"
2655,54,"     that hangs like chains of pearl on hermon hill,"""
2656,54,"     have stirred from out the abysses of his heart,"
2657,54,"     unthought-like thoughts that are the souls of thought,"
2658,54,"     richer, far wilder, far diviner visions"
2659,54,"     than even seraph harper, israfel,"
2660,54,"     who has ""the sweetest voice of all god's creatures,"""
2661,54,"     could hope to utter, and i! my spells are broken,"
2662,54,"     the pen falls powerless from my shivering hand,"
2663,54,"     with thy dear name as text, though bidden by thee,"
2664,54,"     i cannot write- i cannot speak or think-"
2665,54,"     alas, i cannot feel; for 'tis not feeling,"
2666,54,"     this standing motionless upon the golden"
2667,54,"     threshold of the wide-open gate of dreams,"
2668,54,"     gazing, entranced, adown the gorgeous vista,"
2669,54,"     and thrilling as i see, upon the right,"
2670,54,"     upon the left, and all the way along,"
2671,54,"     amid empurpled vapors, far away"
2672,54,"     to where the prospect terminates- thee only,"
2673,55,"beloved! amid the earnest woes"
2674,55,"        that crowd around my earthly path-"
2675,55,"      drear path, alas! where grows"
2676,55,"      not even one lonely rose-"
2677,55,"        my soul at least a solace hath"
2678,55,"      in dreams of thee, and therein knows"
2679,55,"      an eden of bland repose,"
2680,55,""
2681,55,"      and thus thy memory is to me"
2682,55,"        like some enchanted far-off isle"
2683,55,"      in some tumultuous sea-"
2684,55,"      some ocean throbbing far and free"
2685,55,"        with storms- but where meanwhile"
2686,55,"      serenest skies continually"
2687,55,"      just o'er that one bright island smile,"
2688,56,"thou wouldst be loved?- then let thy heart"
2689,56,"             from its present pathway part not!"
2690,56,"           being everything which now thou art,"
2691,56,"             be nothing which thou art not,"
2692,56,"           so with the world thy gentle ways,"
2693,56,"             thy grace, thy more than beauty,"
2694,56,"           shall be an endless theme of praise,"
2695,56,"             and love- a simple duty,"
2696,57,"i saw thee once- once only- years ago,"
2697,57,"i must not say how many- but not many,"
2698,57,"it was a july midnight; and from out"
2699,57,"a full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring,"
2700,57,"sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,"
2701,57,"there fell a silvery-silken veil of light,"
2702,57,"with quietude, and sultriness, and slumber,"
2703,57,"upon the upturned faces of a thousand"
2704,57,"roses that grew in an enchanted garden,"
2705,57,"where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe-"
2706,57,"fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses"
2707,57,"that gave out, in return for the love-light,"
2708,57,"their odorous souls in an ecstatic death-"
2709,57,"fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses"
2710,57,"that smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted"
2711,57,"by thee, and by the poetry of thy presence,"
2712,57,"clad all in white, upon a violet bank"
2713,57,"i saw thee half reclining; while the moon"
2714,57,"fell on the upturn'd faces of the roses,"
2715,57,"and on thine own, upturn'd- alas, in sorrow!"
2716,57,""
2717,57,"was it not fate, that, on this july midnight-"
2718,57,"was it not fate, whose name is also sorrow,"
2719,57,"that bade me pause before that garden-gate,"
2720,57,"to breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?"
2721,57,"no footstep stirred, the hated world an slept,"
2722,57,"save only thee and me, oh, heaven!- oh, god!"
2723,57,"how my heart beats in coupling those two words!"
2724,57,"save only thee and me, i paused- i looked-"
2725,57,"and in an instant all things disappeared,"
2726,57,"ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!"
2727,57,""
2728,57,"the pearly lustre of the moon went out,"
2729,57,"the mossy banks and the meandering paths,"
2730,57,"the happy flowers and the repining trees,"
2731,57,"were seen no more, the very roses' odors"
2732,57,"died in the arms of the adoring airs,"
2733,57,"all- all expired save thee- save less than thou,"
2734,57,"save only the divine light in thine eyes-"
2735,57,"save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes,"
2736,57,"i saw but them- they were the world to me!"
2737,57,"i saw but them- saw only them for hours,"
2738,57,"saw only them until the moon went down,"
2739,57,"what wild heart-histories seemed to he enwritten"
2740,57,"upon those crystalline, celestial spheres!"
2741,57,"how dark a woe, yet how sublime a hope!"
2742,57,"how silently serene a sea of pride!"
2743,57,"how daring an ambition; yet how deep-"
2744,57,how fathomless a capacity for love!
2745,57,""
2746,57,"but now, at length, dear dian sank from sight,"
2747,57,"into a western couch of thunder-cloud;"
2748,57,"and thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees"
2749,57,"didst glide away, only thine eyes remained;"
2750,57,"they would not go- they never yet have gone;"
2751,57,"lighting my lonely pathway home that night,"
2752,57,"they have not left me as my hopes have since;"
2753,57,"they follow me- they lead me through the years,"
2754,57,"they are my ministers- yet i their slave,"
2755,57,"their office is to illumine and enkindle-"
2756,57,"my duty, to be saved by their bright light,"
2757,57,"and purified in their electric fire,"
2758,57,"and sanctified in their elysian fire,"
2759,57,"they fill my soul with beauty which is hope,"
2760,57,"and are far up in heaven- the stars i kneel to"
2761,57,"in the sad, silent watches of my night;"
2762,57,"while even in the meridian glare of day"
2763,57,"i see them still- two sweetly scintillant"
2764,57,"venuses, unextinguished by the sun!"
2765,58,"helen, thy beauty is to me"
2766,58,"        like those nicean barks of yore,"
2767,58,"      that gently, o'er a perfumed sea,"
2768,58,"        the weary, wayworn wanderer bore"
2769,58,"        to his own native shore,"
2770,58,""
2771,58,"      on desperate seas long wont to roam,"
2772,58,"        thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,"
2773,58,"      thy naiad airs have brought me home"
2774,58,"        to the glory that was greece"
2775,58,"      and the grandeur that was rome,"
2776,58,""
2777,58,"      lo! in yon brilliant window-niche"
2778,58,"        how statue-like i see thee stand,"
2779,58,"        the agate lamp within thy hand!"
2780,58,"      ah, psyche, from the regions which"
2781,58,        are holy land!
2782,59,"o! i care not that my earthly lot"
2783,59,"       hath little of earth in it,"
2784,59,"     that years of love have been forgot"
2785,59,"       in the fever of a minute,"
2786,59,""
2787,59,"     i heed not that the desolate"
2788,59,"       are happier, sweet, than i,"
2789,59,"     but that you meddle with my fate"
2790,59,"       who am a passer by,"
2791,59,""
2792,59,"     it is not that my founts of bliss"
2793,59,"       are gushing- strange! with tears-"
2794,59,"     or that the thrill of a single kiss"
2795,59,       hath palsied many years-
2796,59,""
2797,59,"     'tis not that the flowers of twenty springs"
2798,59,"       which have wither'd as they rose"
2799,59,"     lie dead on my heart-strings"
2800,59,"       with the weight of an age of snows,"
2801,59,""
2802,59,"     not that the grass- o! may it thrive!"
2803,59,"       on my grave is growing or grown-"
2804,59,"     but that, while i am dead yet alive"
2805,59,"       i cannot be, lady, alone,"
2806,60,"of all who hail thy presence as the morning-"
2807,60,"    of all to whom thine absence is the night-"
2808,60,"    the blotting utterly from out high heaven"
2809,60,"    the sacred sun- of all who, weeping, bless thee"
2810,60,"    hourly for hope- for life- ah! above all,"
2811,60,"    for the resurrection of deep-buried faith"
2812,60,"    in truth- in virtue- in humanity-"
2813,60,"    of all who, on despair's unhallowed bed"
2814,60,"    lying down to die, have suddenly arisen"
2815,60,"    at thy soft-murmured words, ""let there be light!"""
2816,60,"    at the soft-murmured words that were fulfilled"
2817,60,"    in the seraphic glancing of thine eyes-"
2818,60,"    of all who owe thee most- whose gratitude"
2819,60,"    nearest resembles worship- oh, remember"
2820,60,"    the truest- the most fervently devoted,"
2821,60,"    and think that these weak lines are written by him-"
2822,60,"    by him who, as he pens them, thrills to think"
2823,60,"    his spirit is communing with an angel's,"
2824,61,"because i feel that, in the heavens above,"
2825,61,"     the angels, whispering to one another,"
2826,61,"   can find, among their burning terms of love,"
2827,61,"     none so devotional as that of ""mother,"""
2828,61,"   therefore by that dear name i long have called you-"
2829,61,"     you who are more than mother unto me,"
2830,61,"   and fill my heart of hearts, where death installed you"
2831,61,"     in setting my virginia's spirit free,"
2832,61,"   my mother- my own mother, who died early,"
2833,61,"     was but the mother of myself; but you"
2834,61,"   are mother to the one i loved so dearly,"
2835,61,"     and thus are dearer than the mother i knew"
2836,61,"   by that infinity with which my wife"
2837,61,"     was dearer to my soul than its soul-life,"
2838,62,"seraph! thy memory is to me"
2839,62,"like some enchanted far-off isle"
2840,62,"in some tumultuous sea -"
2841,62,"some ocean vexed as it may be"
2842,62,"with storms; but where, meanwhile,"
2843,62,"serenest skies continually"
2844,62,"just o'er that one bright island smile,"
2845,62,"for 'mid the earnest cares and woes"
2846,62,"that crowd around my earthly path,"
2847,62,"sad path, alas, where grows"
2848,62,"not even one lonely rose!"
2849,62,"my soul at least a solace hath"
2850,62,"in dreams of thee; and therein knows"
2851,62,"an eden of bland repose,"
2852,63,"thou wast all that to me, love,"
2853,63,"        for which my soul did pine-"
2854,63,"      a green isle in the sea, love,"
2855,63,"        a fountain and a shrine,"
2856,63,"      all wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers,"
2857,63,"        and all the flowers were mine,"
2858,63,""
2859,63,"      ah, dream too bright to last!"
2860,63,"        ah, starry hope! that didst arise"

2878,63,"        and where thy footstep gleams-"
2879,63,"      in what ethereal dances,"
2880,63,"        by what eternal streams,"
2881,64,"fair river! in thy bright, clear flow"
2882,64,"       of crystal, wandering water,"
2883,64,"     thou art an emblem of the glow"
2884,64,"         of beauty- the unhidden heart-"
2885,64,"         the playful maziness of art"
2886,64,     in old alberto's daughter;

2894,64,"     his heart which trembles at the beam"
2895,64,"       of her soul-searching eyes,"
2896,65,"the skies they were ashen and sober;"
2897,65,"     the leaves they were crispéd and sere--"
2898,65,"    the leaves they were withering and sere;"
2899,65,"  it was night in the lonesome october"
2900,65,"    of my most immemorial year;"
2901,65,"  it was hard by the dim lake of auber,"
2902,65,"    in the misty mid region of weir--"
2903,65,"  it was down by the dank tarn of auber,"
2904,65,"     in the ghoul-haunted woodland of weir,"
2905,65,""
2906,65," here once, through an alley titanic,"
2907,65,"   of cypress, i roamed with my soul--"
2908,65,"   of cypress, with psyche, my soul,"
2909,65," these were days when my heart was volcanic"
2910,65,"   as the scoriac rivers that roll--"

2912,65,"  their sulphurous currents down yaanek"
2913,65,"   in the ultimate climes of the pole--"
2914,65," that groan as they roll down mount yaanek"
2915,65,"   in the realms of the boreal pole,"
2916,65,""
2917,65," our talk had been serious and sober,"
2918,65,"   but our thoughts they were palsied and sere--"
2919,65,"   our memories were treacherous and sere--"
2920,65," for we knew not the month was october,"
2921,65,"   and we marked not the night of the year--"
2922,65,"   ah, night of all nights in the year!"
2923,65," we noted not the dim lake of auber--"
2924,65,"   though once we had journeyed down here--"
2925,65," we remembered not the dank tarn of auber,"
2926,65,"    nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of weir,"
2927,65,""
2928,65," and now, as the night was senescent"
2929,65,"   and star-dials pointed to morn--"
2930,65,"   as the star-dials hinted of morn--"
2931,65," at the end of our path a liquescent"
2932,65,"   and nebulous lustre was born,"
2933,65," out of which a miraculous crescent"
2934,65,"   arose with a duplicate horn--"
2935,65," astarte's bediamonded crescent"
2936,65,"   distinct with its duplicate horn,"
2937,65,""
2938,65," and i said--""she is warmer than dian,"

2946,65," come up, in despite of the lion,"
2947,65,"   to shine on us with her bright eyes--"

2950,65,""
2951,65," but psyche, uplifting her finger,"

2954,65," oh, hasten! oh, let us not linger!"
2955,65,"   oh, fly!--let us fly!--for we must,"""
2956,65," in terror she spoke, letting sink her"
2957,65,"   wings till they trailed in the dust--"
2958,65," in agony sobbed, letting sink her"
2959,65,"   plumes till they trailed in the dust--"
2960,65,"   till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust,"
2961,65,""
2962,65," i replied--""this is nothing but dreaming,"

2968,65," ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,"
2969,65,"   and be sure it will lead us aright--"
2970,65," we safely may trust to a gleaming"

2973,65,""
2974,65," thus i pacified psyche and kissed her,"
2975,65,"   and tempted her out of her gloom--"
2976,65,"   and conquered her scruples and gloom,"
2977,65," and we passed to the end of the vista,"
2978,65,"   but were stopped by the door of a tomb--"
2979,65,"   by the door of a legended tomb;"
2980,65," and i said--""what is written, sweet sister,"
2981,65,"   on the door of this legended tomb?"""
2982,65,"   she replied--""ulalume--ulalume--"

2984,65,""
2985,65," then my heart it grew ashen and sober"
