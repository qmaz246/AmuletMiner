0,A Dream,"In visions of the dark night
       I have dreamed of joy departed-
     But a waking dream of life and light
       Hath left me broken-hearted.

     Ah! what is not a dream by day
       To him whose eyes are cast
     On things around him with a ray
       Turned back upon the past?

     That holy dream- that holy dream,
       While all the world were chiding,
     Hath cheered me as a lovely beam
       A lonely spirit guiding.

     What though that light, thro' storm and night,
       So trembled from afar-
     What could there be more purely bright
       In Truth's day-star?"
1,A Dream Within A Dream,"Take this kiss upon the brow!
And, in parting from you now,
Thus much let me avow-
You are not wrong, who deem
That my days have been a dream;
Yet if hope has flown away
In a night, or in a day,
In a vision, or in none,
Is it therefore the less gone?
All that we see or seem
Is but a dream within a dream.

I stand amid the roar
Of a surf-tormented shore,
And I hold within my hand
Grains of the golden sand-
How few! yet how they creep
Through my fingers to the deep,
While I weep- while I weep!
O God! can I not grasp
Them with a tighter clasp?
O God! can I not save
One from the pitiless wave?
Is all that we see or seem
But a dream within a dream?"
2,A pÆan,"How shall the burial rite be read?
The solemn song be sung ?
The requiem for the loveliest dead,
That ever died so young?

II.

Her friends are gazing on her,
And on her gaudy bier,
And weep ! - oh! to dishonor
Dead beauty with a tear!

III.

They loved her for her wealth -
And they hated her for her pride -
But she grew in feeble health,
And they love her - that she died.

IV.

They tell me (while they speak
Of her ""costly broider'd pall"")
That my voice is growing weak -
That I should not sing at all -

V.

Or that my tone should be
Tun'd to such solemn song
So mournfully - so mournfully,
That the dead may feel no wrong.

VI.

But she is gone above,
With young Hope at her side,
And I am drunk with love
Of the dead, who is my bride. -

VII.

Of the dead - dead who lies
All perfum'd there,
With the death upon her eyes,
And the life upon her hair.

VIII.

Thus on the coffin loud and long
I strike - the murmur sent
Through the grey chambers to my song,
Shall be the accompaniment.

IX.

Thou died'st in thy life's June -
But thou did'st not die too fair:
Thou did'st not die too soon,
Nor with too calm an air.

X.

From more than fiends on earth,
Thy life and love are riven,
To join the untainted mirth
Of more than thrones in heaven -

XII.

Therefore, to thee this night
I will no requiem raise,
But waft thee on thy flight,
With a Pæan of old days."
3,A Valentine,"For her this rhyme is penned, whose luminous eyes,
   Brightly expressive as the twins of Leda,
 Shall find her own sweet name, that nestling lies
   Upon the page, enwrapped from every reader.
 Search narrowly the lines!- they hold a treasure
   Divine- a talisman- an amulet
 That must be worn at heart. Search well the measure-
   The words- the syllables! Do not forget
 The trivialest point, or you may lose your labor
   And yet there is in this no Gordian knot
 Which one might not undo without a sabre,
   If one could merely comprehend the plot.
 Enwritten upon the leaf where now are peering
   Eyes scintillating soul, there lie perdus
 Three eloquent words oft uttered in the hearing
   Of poets, by poets- as the name is a poet's, too,
 Its letters, although naturally lying
   Like the knight Pinto- Mendez Ferdinando-
 Still form a synonym for Truth- Cease trying!
   You will not read the riddle, though you do the best you can do."
4,Al Aaraaf,"PART I

     O! nothing earthly save the ray
     (Thrown back from flowers) of Beauty's eye,
     As in those gardens where the day
     Springs from the gems of Circassy-
     O! nothing earthly save the thrill
     Of melody in woodland rill-
     Or (music of the passion-hearted)
     Joy's voice so peacefully departed
     That like the murmur in the shell,
     Its echo dwelleth and will dwell-
     Oh, nothing of the dross of ours-
     Yet all the beauty- all the flowers
     That list our Love, and deck our bowers-
     Adorn yon world afar, afar-
     The wandering star.

     'Twas a sweet time for Nesace- for there
     Her world lay lolling on the golden air,
     Near four bright suns- a temporary rest-
     An oasis in desert of the blest.
     Away- away- 'mid seas of rays that roll
     Empyrean splendor o'er th' unchained soul-
     The soul that scarce (the billows are so dense)
     Can struggle to its destin'd eminence,-
     To distant spheres, from time to time, she rode
     And late to ours, the favor'd one of God-
     But, now, the ruler of an anchor'd realm,
     She throws aside the sceptre- leaves the helm,
     And, amid incense and high spiritual hymns,
     Laves in quadruple light her angel limbs.

     Now happiest, loveliest in yon lovely Earth,
     Whence sprang the ""Idea of Beauty"" into birth,
     (Falling in wreaths thro' many a startled star,
     Like woman's hair 'mid pearls, until, afar,
     It lit on hills Achaian, and there dwelt)
     She looked into Infinity- and knelt.
     Rich clouds, for canopies, about her curled-
     Fit emblems of the model of her world-
     Seen but in beauty- not impeding sight
     Of other beauty glittering thro' the light-
     A wreath that twined each starry form around,
     And all the opal'd air in color bound.

       All hurriedly she knelt upon a bed
     Of flowers: of lilies such as rear'd the head
     On the fair Capo Deucato, and sprang
     So eagerly around about to hang
     Upon the flying footsteps of- deep pride-
     Of her who lov'd a mortal- and so died.
     The Sephalica, budding with young bees,
     Upreared its purple stem around her knees:-
     And gemmy flower, of Trebizond misnam'd-
     Inmate of highest stars, where erst it sham'd
     All other loveliness:- its honied dew
     (The fabled nectar that the heathen knew)
     Deliriously sweet, was dropp'd from Heaven,
     And fell on gardens of the unforgiven
     In Trebizond- and on a sunny flower
     So like its own above that, to this hour,
     It still remaineth, torturing the bee
     With madness, and unwonted reverie:
     In Heaven, and all its environs, the leaf
     And blossom of the fairy plant in grief
     Disconsolate linger- grief that hangs her head,
     Repenting follies that full long have Red,
     Heaving her white breast to the balmy air,
     Like guilty beauty, chasten'd and more fair:
     Nyctanthes too, as sacred as the light
     She fears to perfume, perfuming the night:
     And Clytia, pondering between many a sun,
     While pettish tears adown her petals run:
     And that aspiring flower that sprang on Earth,
     And died, ere scarce exalted into birth,
     Bursting its odorous heart in spirit to wing
     Its way to Heaven, from garden of a king:
     And Valisnerian lotus, thither flown""
     From struggling with the waters of the Rhone:
     And thy most lovely purple perfume, Zante!
     Isola d'oro!- Fior di Levante!
     And the Nelumbo bud that floats for ever
     With Indian Cupid down the holy river-
     Fair flowers, and fairy! to whose care is given
     To bear the Goddess' song, in odors, up to Heaven:

          ""Spirit! that dwellest where,
            In the deep sky,
          The terrible and fair,
            In beauty vie!
          Beyond the line of blue-
            The boundary of the star
          Which turneth at the view
            Of thy barrier and thy bar-
          Of the barrier overgone
            By the comets who were cast
          From their pride and from their throne
            To be drudges till the last-
          To be carriers of fire
            (The red fire of their heart)
          With speed that may not tire
            And with pain that shall not part-
          Who livest- that we know-
            In Eternity- we feel-
          But the shadow of whose brow
            What spirit shall reveal?
          Tho' the beings whom thy Nesace,
            Thy messenger hath known
          Have dream'd for thy Infinity
            A model of their own-
          Thy will is done, O God!
            The star hath ridden high
          Thro' many a tempest, but she rode
            Beneath thy burning eye;
          And here, in thought, to thee-
            In thought that can alone
          Ascend thy empire and so be
            A partner of thy throne-
          By winged Fantasy,
          My embassy is given,
          Till secrecy shall knowledge be
            In the environs of Heaven.""

     She ceas'd- and buried then her burning cheek
     Abash'd, amid the lilies there, to seek
     A shelter from the fervor of His eye;
     For the stars trembled at the Deity.
     She stirr'd not- breath'd not- for a voice was there
     How solemnly pervading the calm air!
     A sound of silence on the startled ear
     Which dreamy poets name ""the music of the sphere.""
     Ours is a world of words: Quiet we call
     ""Silence""- which is the merest word of all.
     All Nature speaks, and ev'n ideal things
     Flap shadowy sounds from visionary wings-
     But ah! not so when, thus, in realms on high
     The eternal voice of God is passing by,
     And the red winds are withering in the sky:-

       ""What tho 'in worlds which sightless cycles run,
     Linked to a little system, and one sun-
     Where all my love is folly and the crowd
     Still think my terrors but the thunder cloud,
     The storm, the earthquake, and the ocean-wrath-
     (Ah! will they cross me in my angrier path?)
     What tho' in worlds which own a single sun
     The sands of Time grow dimmer as they run,
     Yet thine is my resplendency, so given
     To bear my secrets thro' the upper Heaven!
     Leave tenantless thy crystal home, and fly,
     With all thy train, athwart the moony sky-
     Apart- like fire-flies in Sicilian night,
     And wing to other worlds another light!
     Divulge the secrets of thy embassy
     To the proud orbs that twinkle- and so be
     To ev'ry heart a barrier and a ban
     Lest the stars totter in the guilt of man!""

       Up rose the maiden in the yellow night,
     The single-mooned eve!- on Earth we plight
     Our faith to one love- and one moon adore-
     The birth-place of young Beauty had no more.
     As sprang that yellow star from downy hours
     Up rose the maiden from her shrine of flowers,
     And bent o'er sheeny mountains and dim plain
     Her way, but left not yet her Therasaean reign.
                   PART II

     High on a mountain of enamell'd head-
     Such as the drowsy shepherd on his bed
     Of giant pasturage lying at his ease,
     Raising his heavy eyelid, starts and sees
     With many a mutter'd ""hope to be forgiven""
     What time the moon is quadrated in Heaven-
     Of rosy head that, towering far away
     Into the sunlit ether, caught the ray
     Of sunken suns at eve- at noon of night,
     While the moon danc'd with the fair stranger light-
     Uprear'd upon such height arose a pile
     Of gorgeous columns on th' unburthen'd air,
     Flashing from Parian marble that twin smile
     Far down upon the wave that sparkled there,
     And nursled the young mountain in its lair.
     Of molten stars their pavement, such as fall
     Thro' the ebon air, besilvering the pall
     Of their own dissolution, while they die-
     Adorning then the dwellings of the sky.
     A dome, by linked light from Heaven let down,
     Sat gently on these columns as a crown-
     A window of one circular diamond, there,
     Look'd out above into the purple air,
     And rays from God shot down that meteor chain
     And hallow'd all the beauty twice again,
     Save, when, between th' empyrean and that ring,
     Some eager spirit Flapp'd his dusky wing.
     But on the pillars Seraph eyes have seen
     The dimness of this world: that greyish green
     That Nature loves the best Beauty's grave
     Lurk'd in each cornice, round each architrave-
     And every sculptur'd cherub thereabout
     That from his marble dwelling peered out,
     Seem'd earthly in the shadow of his niche-
     Achaian statues in a world so rich!
     Friezes from Tadmor and Persepolis-
     From Balbec, and the stilly, clear abyss
     Of beautiful Gomorrah! O, the wave
     Is now upon thee- but too late to save!

       Sound loves to revel in a summer night:
     Witness the murmur of the grey twilight
     That stole upon the ear, in Eyraco,
     Of many a wild star-gazer long ago-
     That stealeth ever on the ear of him
     Who, musing, gazeth on the distance dim,
     And sees the darkness coming as a cloud-
     Is not its form- its voice- most palpable and loud?

       But what is this?- it cometh, and it brings
     A music with it- 'tis the rush of wings-
     A pause- and then a sweeping, falling strain
     And Nesace is in her halls again.
     From the wild energy of wanton haste
       Her cheeks were flushing, and her lips apart;
     And zone that clung around her gentle waist
       Had burst beneath the heaving of her heart.
     Within the centre of that hall to breathe,
     She paused and panted, Zanthe! all beneath,
     The fairy light that kiss'd her golden hair
     And long'd to rest, yet could but sparkle there.

       Young flowers were whispering in melody
     To happy flowers that night- and tree to tree;
     Fountains were gushing music as they fell
     In many a star-lit grove, or moon-lit dell;
     Yet silence came upon material things-
     Fair flowers, bright waterfalls and angel wings-
     And sound alone that from the spirit sprang
     Bore burthen to the charm the maiden sang:

            ""'Neath the blue-bell or streamer-
            Or tufted wild spray
          That keeps, from the dreamer,
            The moonbeam away-
          Bright beings! that ponder,
            With half closing eyes,
          On the stars which your wonder
            Hath drawn from the skies,
          Till they glance thro' the shade, and
            Come down to your brow
          Like- eyes of the maiden
            Who calls on you now-
          Arise! from your dreaming
            In violet bowers,
          To duty beseeming
            These star-litten hours-
          And shake from your tresses
            Encumber'd with dew
          The breath of those kisses
            That cumber them too-
          (O! how, without you, Love!
            Could angels be blest?)
          Those kisses of true Love
            That lull'd ye to rest!
          Up!- shake from your wing
            Each hindering thing:
          The dew of the night-
            It would weigh down your flight
          And true love caresses-
            O, leave them apart!
          They are light on the tresses,
            But lead on the heart.

          Ligeia! Ligeia!
            My beautiful one!
          Whose harshest idea
            Will to melody run,
          O! is it thy will
            On the breezes to toss?
          Or, capriciously still,
            Like the lone Albatros,
          Incumbent on night
            (As she on the air)
          To keep watch with delight
            On the harmony there?

          Ligeia! wherever
            Thy image may be,
          No magic shall sever
            Thy music from thee.
          Thou hast bound many eyes
            In a dreamy sleep-
          But the strains still arise
            Which thy vigilance keep-
          The sound of the rain,
            Which leaps down to the flower-
          And dances again
            In the rhythm of the shower-
          The murmur that springs
            From the growing of grass
          Are the music of things-
            But are modell'd, alas!-
          Away, then, my dearest,
            Oh! hie thee away
          To the springs that lie clearest
            Beneath the moon-ray-
          To lone lake that smiles,
            In its dream of deep rest,
          At the many star-isles
            That enjewel its breast-
          Where wild flowers, creeping,
            Have mingled their shade,
          On its margin is sleeping
            Full many a maid-
          Some have left the cool glade, and
            Have slept with the bee-
          Arouse them, my maiden,
            On moorland and lea-
          Go! breathe on their slumber,
            All softly in ear,
          Thy musical number
            They slumbered to hear-
          For what can awaken
            An angel so soon,
          Whose sleep hath been taken
            Beneath the cold moon,
          As the spell which no slumber
            Of witchery may test,
          The rhythmical number
            Which lull'd him to rest?""

     Spirits in wing, and angels to the view,
     A thousand seraphs burst th' Empyrean thro',
     Young dreams still hovering on their drowsy flight-
     Seraphs in all but ""Knowledge,"" the keen light
     That fell, refracted, thro' thy bounds, afar,
     O Death! from eye of God upon that star:
     Sweet was that error- sweeter still that death-
     Sweet was that error- even with us the breath
     Of Science dims the mirror of our joy-
     To them 'twere the Simoom, and would destroy-
     For what (to them) availeth it to know
     That Truth is Falsehood- or that Bliss is Woe?
     Sweet was their death- with them to die was rife
     With the last ecstasy of satiate life-
     Beyond that death no immortality-
     But sleep that pondereth and is not ""to be'!-
     And there- oh! may my weary spirit dwell-
     Apart from Heaven's Eternity- and yet how far from Hell!
     What guilty spirit, in what shrubbery dim,
     Heard not the stirring summons of that hymn?
     But two: they fell: for Heaven no grace imparts
     To those who hear not for their beating hearts.
     A maiden-angel and her seraph-lover-
     O! where (and ye may seek the wide skies over)
     Was Love, the blind, near sober Duty known?
     Unguided Love hath fallen- 'mid ""tears of perfect moan.""
     He was a goodly spirit- he who fell:
     A wanderer by moss-y-mantled well-
     A gazer on the lights that shine above-
     A dreamer in the moonbeam by his love:
     What wonder? for each star is eye-like there,
     And looks so sweetly down on Beauty's hair-
     And they, and ev'ry mossy spring were holy
     To his love-haunted heart and melancholy.
     The night had found (to him a night of woe)
     Upon a mountain crag, young Angelo-
     Beetling it bends athwart the solemn sky,
     And scowls on starry worlds that down beneath it lie.
     Here sat he with his love- his dark eye bent
     With eagle gaze along the firmament:
     Now turn'd it upon her- but ever then
     It trembled to the orb of EARTH again.

     ""Ianthe, dearest, see- how dim that ray!
     How lovely 'tis to look so far away!
     She seem'd not thus upon that autumn eve
     I left her gorgeous halls- nor mourn'd to leave.
     That eve- that eve- I should remember well-
     The sun-ray dropp'd in Lemnos, with a spell
     On th' arabesque carving of a gilded hall
     Wherein I sate, and on the draperied wall-
     And on my eyelids- O the heavy light!
     How drowsily it weigh'd them into night!
     On flowers, before, and mist, and love they ran
     With Persian Saadi in his Gulistan:
     But O that light!- I slumber'd- Death, the while,
     Stole o'er my senses in that lovely isle
     So softly that no single silken hair
     Awoke that slept- or knew that he was there.

     ""The last spot of Earth's orb I trod upon
     Was a proud temple call'd the Parthenon;
     More beauty clung around her column'd wall
     Than ev'n thy glowing bosom beats withal,
     And when old Time my wing did disenthral
     Thence sprang I- as the eagle from his tower,
     And years I left behind me in an hour.
     What time upon her airy bounds I hung,
     One half the garden of her globe was flung
     Unrolling as a chart unto my view-
     Tenantless cities of the desert too!
     Ianthe, beauty crowded on me then,
     And half I wish'd to be again of men.""

     ""My Angelo! and why of them to be?
     A brighter dwelling-place is here for thee-
     And greener fields than in yon world above,
     And woman's loveliness- and passionate love.""

     ""But, list, Ianthe! when the air so soft
     Fail'd, as my pennon'd spirit leapt aloft,
     Perhaps my brain grew dizzy- but the world
     I left so late was into chaos hurl'd-
     Sprang from her station, on the winds apart.
     And roll'd, a flame, the fiery Heaven athwart.
     Methought, my sweet one, then I ceased to soar
     And fell- not swiftly as I rose before,
     But with a downward, tremulous motion thro'
     Light, brazen rays, this golden star unto!
     Nor long the measure of my falling hours,
     For nearest of all stars was thine to ours-
     Dread star! that came, amid a night of mirth,
     A red Daedalion on the timid Earth.""

     ""We came- and to thy Earth- but not to us
     Be given our lady's bidding to discuss:
     We came, my love; around, above, below,
     Gay fire-fly of the night we come and go,
     Nor ask a reason save the angel-nod
     She grants to us, as granted by her God-
     But, Angelo, than thine grey Time unfurl'd
     Never his fairy wing O'er fairier world!
     Dim was its little disk, and angel eyes
     Alone could see the phantom in the skies,
     When first Al Aaraaf knew her course to be
     Headlong thitherward o'er the starry sea-
     But when its glory swell'd upon the sky,
     As glowing Beauty's bust beneath man's eye,
     We paused before the heritage of men,
     And thy star trembled- as doth Beauty then!""

     Thus, in discourse, the lovers whiled away
     The night that waned and waned and brought no day.
     They fell: for Heaven to them no hope imparts
     Who hear not for the beating of their hearts."
5,Alone,"From childhood's hour I have not been
As others were; I have not seen
As others saw; I could not bring
My passions from a common spring.
From the same source I have not taken
My sorrow; I could not awaken
My heart to joy at the same tone;
And all I loved, I loved alone.
Then- in my childhood, in the dawn
Of a most stormy life- was drawn
From every depth of good and ill
The mystery which binds me still:
From the torrent, or the fountain,
From the red cliff of the mountain,
From the sun that round me rolled
In its autumn tint of gold,
From the lightning in the sky
As it passed me flying by,
From the thunder and the storm,
And the cloud that took the form
(When the rest of Heaven was blue)
Of a demon in my view."
6,An Acrostic,"Elizabeth it is in vain you say
""Love not"" — thou sayest it in so sweet a way:
In vain those words from thee or L. E. L.
Zantippe's talents had enforced so well:
Ah! if that language from thy heart arise,
Breathe it less gently forth — and veil thine eyes.
Endymion, recollect, when Luna tried
To cure his love — was cured of all beside —
His folly — pride — and passion — for he died."
7,An Enigma,"""Seldom we find,"" says Solomon Don Dunce,
       ""Half an idea in the profoundest sonnet.
     Through all the flimsy things we see at once
       As easily as through a Naples bonnet-
       Trash of all trash!- how can a lady don it?
     Yet heavier far than your Petrarchan stuff-
     Owl-downy nonsense that the faintest puff
       Twirls into trunk-paper the while you con it.""
     And, veritably, Sol is right enough.
     The general tuckermanities are arrant
     Bubbles- ephemeral and so transparent-
       But this is, now- you may depend upon it-
     Stable, opaque, immortal- all by dint
     Of the dear names that he concealed within 't."
8,Annabel Lee,"It was many and many a year ago,
         In a kingdom by the sea,
   That a maiden there lived whom you may know
         By the name of ANNABEL LEE;
   And this maiden she lived with no other thought
         Than to love and be loved by me.

   I was a child and she was a child,
         In this kingdom by the sea;
   But we loved with a love that was more than love-
         I and my Annabel Lee;
   With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
         Coveted her and me.

   And this was the reason that, long ago,
         In this kingdom by the sea,
   A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
         My beautiful Annabel Lee;
   So that her highborn kinsman came
         And bore her away from me,
   To shut her up in a sepulchre
         In this kingdom by the sea.

   The angels, not half so happy in heaven,
         Went envying her and me-
   Yes!- that was the reason (as all men know,
         In this kingdom by the sea)
   That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
         Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.

   But our love it was stronger by far than the love
         Of those who were older than we-
         Of many far wiser than we-
   And neither the angels in heaven above,
         Nor the demons down under the sea,
   Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
         Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.

   For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
         Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
   And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes
         Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
   And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
   Of my darling- my darling- my life and my bride,
         In the sepulchre there by the sea,
         In her tomb by the sounding sea."
9,Bridal Ballad,"The ring is on my hand,
        And the wreath is on my brow;
      Satin and jewels grand
      Are all at my command,
        And I am happy now.

      And my lord he loves me well;
        But, when first he breathed his vow,
      I felt my bosom swell-
      For the words rang as a knell,
      And the voice seemed his who fell
      In the battle down the dell,
        And who is happy now.

      But he spoke to re-assure me,
        And he kissed my pallid brow,
      While a reverie came o'er me,
      And to the church-yard bore me,
      And I sighed to him before me,
      Thinking him dead D'Elormie,
      ""Oh, I am happy now!""

      And thus the words were spoken,
        And this the plighted vow,
      And, though my faith be broken,
      And, though my heart be broken,
      Here is a ring, as token
        That I am happy now!

      Would God I could awaken!
        For I dream I know not how!
      And my soul is sorely shaken
      Lest an evil step be taken,-
      Lest the dead who is forsaken
        May not be happy now."
10,DreamLand,"By a route obscure and lonely,
Haunted by ill angels only,
Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,
On a black throne reigns upright,
I have reached these lands but newly
From an ultimate dim Thule-
From a wild clime that lieth, sublime,
Out of SPACE- out of TIME.

Bottomless vales and boundless floods,
And chasms, and caves, and Titan woods,
With forms that no man can discover
For the tears that drip all over;
Mountains toppling evermore
Into seas without a shore;
Seas that restlessly aspire,
Surging, unto skies of fire;
Lakes that endlessly outspread
Their lone waters- lone and dead,-
Their still waters- still and chilly
With the snows of the lolling lily.

By the lakes that thus outspread
Their lone waters, lone and dead,-
Their sad waters, sad and chilly
With the snows of the lolling lily,-
By the mountains- near the river
Murmuring lowly, murmuring ever,-
By the grey woods,- by the swamp
Where the toad and the newt encamp-
By the dismal tarns and pools
Where dwell the Ghouls,-
By each spot the most unholy-
In each nook most melancholy-
There the traveller meets aghast
Sheeted Memories of the Past-
Shrouded forms that start and sigh
As they pass the wanderer by-
White-robed forms of friends long given,
In agony, to the Earth- and Heaven.

For the heart whose woes are legion
'Tis a peaceful, soothing region-
For the spirit that walks in shadow
'Tis- oh, 'tis an Eldorado!
But the traveller, travelling through it,
May not- dare not openly view it!
Never its mysteries are exposed
To the weak human eye unclosed;
So wills its King, who hath forbid
The uplifting of the fringed lid;
And thus the sad Soul that here passes
Beholds it but through darkened glasses.

By a route obscure and lonely,
Haunted by ill angels only,
Where an Eidolon, named NIGHT,
On a black throne reigns upright,
I have wandered home but newly
From this ultimate dim Thule."
11,Dreams,"Oh! that my young life were a lasting dream!
   My spirit not awakening, till the beam
   Of an Eternity should bring the morrow.
   Yes! tho' that long dream were of hopeless sorrow,
   'Twere better than the cold reality
   Of waking life, to him whose heart must be,
   And hath been still, upon the lovely earth,
   A chaos of deep passion, from his birth.
   But should it be- that dream eternally
   Continuing- as dreams have been to me
   In my young boyhood- should it thus be given,
   'Twere folly still to hope for higher Heaven.
   For I have revell'd, when the sun was bright
   I' the summer sky, in dreams of living light
   And loveliness,- have left my very heart
   In climes of my imagining, apart
   From mine own home, with beings that have been
   Of mine own thought- what more could I have seen?
   'Twas once- and only once- and the wild hour
   From my remembrance shall not pass- some power
   Or spell had bound me- 'twas the chilly wind
   Came o'er me in the night, and left behind
   Its image on my spirit- or the moon
   Shone on my slumbers in her lofty noon
   Too coldly- or the stars- howe'er it was
   That dream was as that night-wind- let it pass.

   I have been happy, tho' in a dream.
   I have been happy- and I love the theme:
   Dreams! in their vivid coloring of life,
   As in that fleeting, shadowy, misty strife
   Of semblance with reality, which brings
   To the delirious eye, more lovely things
   Of Paradise and Love- and all our own!
   Than young Hope in his sunniest hour hath known."
12,Eldorado,"Gaily bedight,
                  A gallant knight,
              In sunshine and in shadow,
                  Had journeyed long,
                  Singing a song,
              In search of Eldorado.

                  But he grew old-
                  This knight so bold-
              And o'er his heart a shadow
                  Fell as he found
                  No spot of ground
              That looked like Eldorado.

                  And, as his strength
                  Failed him at length,
              He met a pilgrim shadow-
                  ""Shadow,"" said he,
                  ""Where can it be-
              This land of Eldorado?""

                  ""Over the Mountains
                  Of the Moon,
              Down the Valley of the Shadow,
                  Ride, boldly ride,""
                  The shade replied-
              ""If you seek for Eldorado!"""

17,Eureka - A Prose Poem,"EUREKA:

AN ESSAY ON THE MATERIAL AND SPIRITUAL UNIVERSE

IT is with humility really unassumed -–it is with a sentiment even of awe -–that I pen the opening sentence of this work: for of all conceivable subjects I approach the reader with the most solemn -–the most comprehensive -–the most difficult -–the most august.

What terms shall I find sufficiently simple in their sublimity -- sufficiently sublime in their simplicity -–for the mere enunciation of my theme?

I design to speak of the Physical, Metaphysical and Mathematical -- of the Material and Spiritual Universe:–of its Essence, its Origin, its Creation, its Present Condition and its Destiny. I shall be so rash, moreover, as to chAllange the conclusions, and thus, in effect, to question the sagacity, of many of the greatest and most justly reverenced of men.

In the beginning, let me as distinctly as possible announce -–not the theorem which I hope to demonstrate -–for, whatever the mathematicians may assert, there is, in this world at least, no such thing as demonstration -–but the ruling idea which, throughout this volume, I shall be continually endeavoring to suggest.

My general proposition, then, is this: -–In the Original Unity of the First Thing lies the Secondary Cause of All Things, with the Germ of their Inevitable Annihilation.

In illustration of this idea, I propose to take such a survey of the Universe that the mind may be able really to receive and to perceive an individual impression.

He who from the top of AEtna casts his eyes leisurely around, is affected chiefly by the extent and diversity of the scene. Only by a rapid whirling on his heel could he hope to comprehend the panorama in the sublimity of its oneness. But as, on the summit of AEtna, no man has thought of whirling on his heel, so no man has ever taken into his brain the full uniqueness of the prospect; and so, again, whatever considerations lie involved in this uniqueness, have as yet no practical existence for mankind.

I do not know a treatise in which a survey of the Universe -- using the word in its most comprehensive and only legitimate acceptation -–is taken at all: -–and it may be as well here to mention that by the term ""Universe,"" wherever employed without qualification in this essay, I mean to designate the utmost conceivable expanse of space, with all things, spiritual and material, that can he imagined to exist within the compass of that expanse. In speaking of what is ordinarily implied by the expression, ""Universe,"" I shall take a phrase of limitation -–""the Universe of stars."" Why this distinction is considered necessary, will be seen in the sequel.

But even of treatises on the really limited, although always assumed as the un limited, Universe of stars, I know none in which a survey, even of this limited Universe, is so taken as to warrant deductions from its individuality. The nearest approach to such a work is made in the ""Cosmos"" of Alexander Von Humboldt. He presents the subject, however, not in its individuality but in its generality. His theme, in its last result, is the law of each portion of the merely physical Universe, as this law is related to the laws of every other portion of this merely physical Universe. His design is simply synoeretical. In a word, he discusses the universality of material relation, and discloses to the eye of Philosophy whatever inferences have hitherto lain hidden behind this universality. But however admirable be the succinctness with which he has treated each particular point of his topic, the mere multiplicity of these points occasions, necessarily, an amount of detail, and thus an involution of idea, which preclude all individuality of impression.

It seems to me that, in aiming at this latter effect, and, through it, at the consequences -–the conclusions -–the suggestions -–the speculations -–or, if nothing better offer itself, the mere guesses which may result from it -–we require something like a mental gyration on the heel. We need so rapid a revolution of all things about the central point of sight that, while the minutiae vanish altogether, even the more conspicuous objects become blended into one. Among the vanishing minutiae, in a survey of this kind, would be all exclusively terrestrial matters. The Earth would be considered in its planetary relations alone. A man, in this view, becomes mankind; mankind a member of the cosmical family of Intelligences.

And now, before proceeding to our subject proper, let me beg the reader's attention to an extract or two from a somewhat remarkable letter, which appears to have been found corked in a bottle and floating on the Mare Tenebrarum–an ocean well described by the Nubian geographer, Ptolemy Hephestion, but little frequented in modern days unless by the Transcendentalists and some other divers for crotchets. The date of this letter, I confess, surprises me even more particularly than its contents; for it seems to have been written in the year Two thousand eight hundred and forty-eight. As for the passages I am about to transcribe, they, I fancy, will speak for themselves.

""Do you know, my dear friend,"" says the writer, addressing, no doubt, a contemporary -–""Do you know that it is scarcely more than eight or nine hundred years ago since the metaphysicians first consented to relieve the people of the singular fancy that there exist but two practicable roads to Truth? Believe it if you can! It appears, however, that long, long ago, in the night of Time, there lived a Turkish philosopher called Aries and surnamed Tottle."" [Here, possibly, the letter-writer means Aristotle; the best names are wretchedly corrupted in two or three thousand years.] ""The fame of this great man depended mainly upon his demonstration that sneezing is a natural provision, by means of which over-profound thinkers are enabled to expel superfluous ideas through the nose; but he obtained a scarcely less valuable celebrity as the founder, or at all events as the principal propagator, of what was termed the de ductive or a priori philosophy. He started with what he maintained to be axioms, or self-evident truths: -–and the now well-understood fact that no truths are self -evident, really does not make in the slightest degree against his speculations: -–it was sufficient for his purpose that the truths in question were evident at all. From axioms he proceeded, logically, to results. His most illustrious disciples were one Tuclid, a geometrician,"" [meaning Euclid] ""and one Kant, a Dutchman, the originator of that species of Transcendentalism which, with the change merely of a C for a K, now bears his peculiar name.

""Well, Aries Tottle flourished supreme, until the advent of one Hog, surnamed 'the Ettrick shepherd,' who preached an entirely different system, which he called the a posteriori or in ductive. His plan referred altogether to sensation. He proceeded by observing, analyzing, and classifying facts -–instantiae Naturae, as they were somewhat affectedly called -–and arranging them into general laws. In a word, while the mode of Aries rested on noumena, that of Hog depended on phenomena; and so great was the admiration excited by this latter system that, at its first introduction, Aries fell into general disrepute. Finally, however, he recovered ground, and was permitted to divide the empire of Philosophy with his more modern rival: -–the savans contenting themselves with proscribing all other competitors, past, present, and to come; putting an end to all controversy on the topic by the promulgation of a Median law, to the effect that the Aristotelian and Baconian roads are, and of right ought to be, the sole possible avenues to knowledge: -–'Baconian,' you must know, my dear friend,"" adds the letter-writer at this point, ""was an adjective invented as equivalent to Hog-ian, and at the same time more dignified and euphonious.

""Now I do assure you most positively"" -–proceeds the epistle -–""that I represent these matters fairly; and you can easily understand how restrictions so absurd on their very face must have operated, in those days, to retard the progress of true Science, which makes its most important advances -–as all History will show -–by seemingly intuitive leaps. These ancient ideas confined investigation to crawling; and I need not suggest to you that crawling, among varieties of locomotion, is a very capital thing of its kind; -–but because the tortoise is sure of foot, for this reason must we clip the wings of the eagles? For many centuries, so great was the infatuation, about Hog especially, that a virtual stop was put to all thinking, properly so called. No man dared utter a truth for which he felt himself indebted to his soul alone. It mattered not whether the truth was even demonstrably such; for the dogmatizing philosophers of that epoch regarded only the road by which it professed to have been attained. The end, with them, was a point of no moment, whatever: -–'the means!' they vociferated -–'let us look at the means!' -- and if, on scrutiny of the means, it was found to come neither under the category Hog, nor under the category Aries (which means ram), why then the savans went no farther, but, calling the thinker a fool and branding him a 'theorist,' would never, thenceforward, have any thing to do either with him or with his truths.

""Now, my dear friend,"" continues the letter-writer, ""it cannot be maintained that by the crawling system, exclusively adopted, men would arrive at the maximum amount of truth, even in any long series of ages; for the repression of imagination was an evil not to be counterbalanced even by absolute certainty in the snail processes. But their certainty was very far from absolute. The error of our progenitors was quite analogous with that of the wiseacre who fancies he must necessarily see an object the more distinctly, the more closely he holds it to his eyes. They blinded themselves, too, with the impalpable, titillating Scotch snuff of detail; and thus the boasted facts of the Hog-ites were by no means always facts -–a point of little importance but for the assumption that they always were. The vital taint, however, in Baconianism -–its most lamentable fount of error -–lay in its tendency to throw power and consideration into the hands of merely perceptive men -–of those inter-Tritonic minnows, the microscopical savans -–the diggers and pedlers of minute facts, for the most part in physical science -- facts all of which they retailed at the same price upon the highway; their value depending, it was supposed, simply upon the fact of their fact, without reference to their applicability or inapplicability in the development of those ultimate and only legitimate facts, called Law.

""Than the persons"" -–the letter goes on to say -–""than the persons thus suddenly elevated by the Hog-ian philosophy into a station for which they were unfitted -–thus transferred from the sculleries into the parlors of Science -–from its pantries into its pulpits -–than these individuals a more intolerant -–a more intolerable set of bigots and tyrants never existed on the face of the earth. Their creed, their text and their sermon were, alike, the one word 'fact' -–but, for the most part, even of this one word, they knew not even the meaning. On those who ventured to disturb their facts with the view of putting them in order and to use, the disciples of Hog had no mercy whatever. All attempts at generalization were met at once by the words 'theoretical,' 'theory,' 'theorist' -–all thought, to be brief, was very properly resented as a personal affront to themselves. Cultivating the natural sciences to the exclusion of Metaphysics, the Mathematics, and Logic, many of these Bacon-engendered philosophers -–one-idead, one-sided and lame of a leg -–were more wretchedly helpless -–more miserably ignorant, in view of all the comprehensible objects of knowledge, than the veriest unlettered hind who proves that he knows something at least, in admitting that he knows absolutely nothing.

""Nor had our forefathers any better right to talk about certainty, when pursuing, in blind confidence, the a priori path of axioms, or of the Ram. At innumerable points this path was scarcely as straight as a ram's-horn. The simple truth is, that the Aristotelians erected their castles upon a basis far less reliable than air; for no such things as axioms ever existed or can possibly exist at all. This they must have been very blind, indeed, not to see, or at least to suspect; for, even in their own day, many of their long-admitted 'axioms' had been abandoned: -–'ex nihilo nihil fit,' for example, and a 'thing cannot act where it is not,' and 'there cannot be antipodes,' and 'darkness cannot proceed from light.' These and numerous similar propositions formerly accepted, without hesitation, as axioms, or undeniable truths, were, even at the period of which I speak, seen to be altogether untenable: -–how absurd in these people, then, to persist in relying upon a basis, as immutable, whose mutability had become so repeatedly manifest!

""But, even through evidence afforded by themselves against themselves, it is easy to convict these a priori reasoners of the grossest unreason -–it is easy to show the futility -–the impalpability of their axioms in general. I have now lying before me"" -- it will be observed that we still proceed with the letter -–""I have now lying before me a book printed about a thousand years ago. Pundit assures me that it is decidedly the cleverest ancient work on its topic, which is 'Logic.' The author, who was much esteemed in his day, was one Miller or Mill; and we find it recorded of him, as a point of some importance, that he rode a mill-horse whom he called Jeremy Bentham: -–but let us glance at the volume itself!

""Ah! -–'Ability or inability to conceive,' says Mr. Mill very properly, 'is in no case to be received as a criterion of axiomatic truth.' Now, that this is a palpable truism no one in his senses will deny. Not to admit the proposition, is to insinuate a charge of variability in Truth itself, whose very title is a synonym of the Steadfast. If ability to conceive be taken as a criterion of Truth, then a truth to David Hume would very seldom be a truth to Joe; and ninety-nine hundredths of what is undeniable in Heaven would be demonstrable falsity upon Earth. The proposition of Mr. Mill, then, is sustained. I will not grant it to be an axiom; and this merely because I am showing that no axioms exist; but, with a distinction which could not have been cavilled at even by Mr. Mill himself, I am ready to grant that, if an axiom there be, then the proposition of which we speak has the fullest right to be considered an axiom -–that no more absolute axiom is -–and, consequently, that any subsequent proposition which shall conflict with this one primarily advanced, must be either a falsity in itself -–that is to say no axiom -–or, if admitted axiomatic, must at once neutralize both itself and its predecessor.

""And now, by the logic of their own propounder, let us proceed to test any one of the axioms propounded. Let us give Mr. Mill the fairest of play. We will bring the point to no ordinary issue. We will select for investigation no common-place axiom -–no axiom of what, not the less preposterously because only impliedly, he terms his secondary class -–as if a positive truth by definition could be either more or less positively a truth: -–we will select, I say, no axiom of an unquestionability so questionable as is to be found in Euclid. We will not talk, for example, about such propositions as that two straight lines cannot enclose a space, or that the whole is greater than any one of its parts. We will afford the logician every advantage. We will come at once to a proposition which he regards as the acme of the unquestionable -–as the quintessence of axiomatic undeniability. Here it is: -–'Contradictions cannot both be true -- that is, cannot coexist in nature.' Here Mr. Mill means, for instance, -–and I give the most forcible instance conceivable -–that a tree must be either a tree or not a tree -–that it cannot be at the same time a tree and not a tree: -–all which is quite reasonable of itself and will answer remarkably well as an axiom, until we bring it into collation with an axiom insisted upon a few pages before -–in other words -–words which I have previously employed -–until we test it by the logic of its own propounder. 'A tree,' Mr. Mill asserts, 'must be either a tree or not a tree.' Very well: -–and now let me ask him, why. To this little query there is but one response: -–I defy any man living to invent a second. The sole answer is this: -- 'Because we find it impossible to conceive that a tree can be anything else than a tree or not a tree.' This, I repeat, is Mr. Mill's sole answer: -–he will not pretend to suggest another: -–and yet, by his own showing, his answer is clearly no answer at all; for has he not already required us to admit, as an axiom, that ability or inability to conceive is in no case to be taken as a criterion of axiomatic truth? Thus all -–absolutely his argumentation is at sea without a rudder. Let it not be urged that an exception from the general rule is to be made, in cases where the 'impossibility to conceive' is so peculiarly great as when we are called upon to conceive a tree both a tree and not a tree. Let no attempt, I say, be made at urging this sotticism; for, in the first place, there are no degrees of 'impossibility,' and thus no one impossible conception can be more peculiarly impossible than another impossible conception: -–in the second place, Mr. Mill himself, no doubt after thorough deliberation, has most distinctly, and most rationally, excluded all opportunity for exception, by the emphasis of his proposition, that, in no case, is ability or inability to conceive, to be taken as a criterion of axiomatic truth: -–in the third place, even were exceptions admissible at all, it remains to be shown how any exception is admissible here. That a tree can be both a tree and not a tree, is an idea which the angels, or the devils, may entertain, and which no doubt many an earthly Bedlamite, or Transcendentalist, does.

""Now I do not quarrel with these ancients,"" continues the letter-writer, ""so much on account of the transparent frivolity of their logic -–which, to be plain, was baseless, worthless and fantastic altogether -–as on account of their pompous and infatuate proscription of all other roads to Truth than the two narrow and crooked paths -–the one of creeping and the other of crawling -–to which, in their ignorant perversity, they have dared to confine the Soul -–the Soul which loves nothing so well as to soar in those regions of illimitable intuition which are utterly incognizant of 'path.'

""By the bye, my dear friend, is it not an evidence of the mental slavery entailed upon those bigoted people by their Hogs and Rams, that in spite of the eternal prating of their savans about roads to Truth, none of them fell, even by accident, into what we now so distinctly perceive to be the broadest, the straightest and most available of all mere roads -–the great thoroughfare -–the majestic highway of the Consistent? Is it not wonderful that they should have failed to deduce from the works of God the vitally momentous consideration that a perfect consistency can be nothing but an absolute truth? How plain -–how rapid our progress since the late announcement of this proposition! By its means, investigation has been taken out of the hands of the ground-moles, and given as a duty, rather than as a task, to the true -–to the only true thinkers -–to the generally-educated men of ardent imagination. These latter -–our Keplers -–our Laplaces -–'speculate' -–'theorize' -–these are the terms -- can you not fancy the shout of scorn with which they would be received by our progenitors, were it possible for them to be looking over my shoulders as I write? The Keplers, I repeat, speculate -–theorize -- and their theories are merely corrected -–reduced -–sifted -–cleared, little by little, of their chaff of inconsistency -–until at length there stands apparent an unencumbered Consistency -–a consistency which the most stolid admit -–because it is a consistency -–to be an absolute and unquestionable TRuth.

""I have often thought, my friend, that it must have puzzled these dogmaticians of a thousand years ago, to determine, even, by which of their two boasted roads it is that the cryptographist attains the solution of the more complicated cyphers -–or by which of them Champollion guided mankind to those important and innumerable truths which, for so many centuries, have lain entombed amid the phonetical hieroglyphics of Egypt. In especial, would it not have given these bigots some trouble to determine by which of their two roads was reached the most momentous and sublime of their truths -–the truth -–the fact of gravitation? Newton deduced it from the laws of Kepler. Kepler admitted that these laws he guessed -–these laws whose investigation disclosed to the greatest of British astronomers that principle, the basis of all (existing) physical principle, in going behind which we enter at once the nebulous kingdom of Metaphysics. Yes! -–these vital laws Kepler guessed -–that it is to say, he imagined them. Had he been asked to point out either the de ductive or in ductive route by which he attained them, his reply might have been -–'I know nothing about routes -–but I do know the machinery of the Universe. Here it is. I grasped it with my soul -–I reached it through mere dint of intuition.' Alas, poor ignorant old man! Could not any metaphysician have told him that what he called 'intuition' was but the conviction resulting from de ductions or in ductions of which the processes were so shadowy as to have escaped his consciousness, eluded his reason, or bidden defiance to his capacity of expression? How great a pity it is that some 'moral philosopher' had not enlightened him about all this! How it would have comforted him on his death-bed to know that, instead of having gone intuitively and thus unbecomingly, he had, in fact, proceeded decorously and legitimately -–that is to say Hog-ishly, or at least Ram-ishly -–into the vast halls where lay gleaming, untended, and hitherto untouched by mortal hand -–unseen by mortal eye -–the imperishable and priceless secrets of the Universe!

""Yes, Kepler was essentially a theorist; but this title, now of so much sanctity, was, in those ancient days, a designation of supreme contempt. It is only now that men begin to appreciate that divine old man -–to sympathize with the prophetical and poetical rhapsody of his ever-memorable words. For my part,"" continues the unknown correspondent, ""I glow with a sacred fire when I even think of them, and feel that I shall never grow weary of their repetition: -- in concluding this letter, let me have the real pleasure of transcribing them once again: -–'I care not whether my work be read now or by posterity. I can afford to wait a century for readers when God himself has waited six thousand years for an observer. I triumph. I have stolen the golden secret of the Egyptians. I will indulge my sacred fury.'""

Here end my quotations from this very unaccountable and, perhaps, somewhat impertinent epistle; and perhaps it would be folly to comment, in any respect, upon the chimerical, not to say revolutionary, fancies of the writer -–whoever he is -–fancies so radically at war with the well-considered and well-settled opinions of this age. Let us proceed, then, to our legitimate thesis, The Universe.

This thesis admits a choice between two modes of discussion: -–We may as cend or des cend. Beginning at our own point of view -–at the Earth on which we stand -–we may pass to the other planets of our system -–thence to the Sun -–thence to our system considered collectively -–and thence, through other systems, indefinitely outwards; or, commencing on high at some point as definite as we can make it or conceive it, we may come down to the habitation of Man. Usually -–that is to say, in ordinary essays on Astronomy -–the first of these two modes is, with certain reservation, adopted: -–this for the obvious reason that astronomical facts, merely, and principles, being the object, that object is best fulfilled in stepping from the known because proximate, gradually onward to the point where all certitude becomes lost in the remote. For my present purpose, however, -–that of enabling the mind to take in, as if from afar and at one glance, a distant conception of the individual Universe -–it is clear that a descent to small from great -–to the outskirts from the centre (if we could establish a centre) -–to the end from the beginning (if we could fancy a beginning) would be the preferable course, but for the difficulty, if not impossibility, of presenting, in this course, to the unastronomical, a picture at all comprehensible in regard to such considerations as are involved in quantity -–that is to say, in number, magnitude and distance.

Now, distinctness -–intelligibility, at all points, is a primary feature in my general design. On important topics it is better to be a good deal prolix than even a very little obscure. But abstruseness is a quality appertaining to no subject per se. All are alike, in facility of comprehension, to him who approaches them by properly graduated steps. It is merely because a stepping-stone, here and there, is heedlessly left unsupplied in our road to the Differential Calculus, that this latter is not altogether as simple a thing as a sonnet by Mr. Solomon Seesaw.

By way of admitting, then, no chance for misapprehension, I think it advisable to proceed as if even the more obvious facts of Astronomy were unknown to the reader. In combining the two modes of discussion to which I have referred, I propose to avail myself of the advantages peculiar to each -–and very especially of the iteration in detail which will be unavoidable as a consequence of the plan. Commencing with a descent, I shall reserve for the return upwards those indispensable considerations of quantity to which allusion has already been made.

Let us begin, then, at once, with that merest of words, ""Infinity."" This, like ""God,"" ""spirit,"" and some other expressions of which the equivalents exist in all languages, is by no means the expression of an idea -–but of an effort at one. It stands for the possible attempt at an impossible conception. Man needed a term by which to point out the direction of this effort -–the cloud behind which lay, forever invisible, the object of this attempt. A word, in fine, was demanded, by means of which one human being might put himself in relation at once with another human being and with a certain tendency of the human intellect. Out of this demand arose the word, ""Infinity;"" which is thus the representative but of the thought of a thought.

As regards that infinity now considered -–the infinity of space -–we often hear it said that ""its idea is admitted by the mind -–is acquiesced in -–is entertained -–on account of the greater difficulty which attends the conception of a limit."" But this is merely one of those phrases by which even profound thinkers, time out of mind, have occasionally taken pleasure in deceiving themselves. The quibble lies concealed in the word ""difficulty."" ""The mind,"" we are told, ""entertains the idea of limitless, through the greater difficulty which it finds in entertaining that of limited, space."" Now, were the proposition but fairly put, its absurdity would become transparent at once. Clearly, there is no mere difficulty in the case. The assertion intended, if presented according to its intention and without sophistry, would run thus: -–""The mind admits the idea of limitless, through the greater impossibility of entertaining that of limited, space.""

It must be immediately seen that this is not a question of two statements between whose respective credibilities -–or of two arguments between whose respective validities -–the reason is called upon to decide: -–it is a matter of two conceptions, directly conflicting, and each avowedly impossible, one of which the intellect is supposed to be capable of entertaining, on account of the greater impossibility of entertaining the other. The choice is not made between two difficulties; -–it is merely fancied to be made between two impossibilities. Now of the former, there are degrees, -–but of the latter, none: -–just as our impertinent letter-writer has already suggested. A task may be more or less difficult; but it is either possible or not possible: -–there are no gradations. It might be more difficult to overthrow the Andes than an ant-hill; but it can be no more impossible to annihilate the matter of the one than the matter of the other. A man may jump ten feet with less difficulty than he can jump twenty, but the impossibility of his leaping to the moon is not a whit less than that of his leaping to the dog-star.

Since all this is undeniable: since the choice of the mind is to be made between impossibilities of conception: since one impossibility cannot be greater than another: and since, thus, one cannot be preferred to another: the philosophers who not only maintain, on the grounds mentioned, man's idea of infinity but, on account of such supposititious idea, infinity itself -–are plainly engaged in demonstrating one impossible thing to be possible by showing how it is that some one other thing -–is impossible too. This, it will be said, is nonsense; and perhaps it is: -–indeed I think it very capital nonsense -–but forego all claim to it as nonsense of mine.

The readiest mode, however, of displaying the fallacy of the philosophical argument on this question, is by simply adverting to a fact respecting it which has been hitherto quite overlooked -–the fact that the argument alluded to both proves and disproves its own proposition. ""The mind is impelled,"" say the theologians and others, ""to admit a First Cause, by the superior difficulty it experiences in conceiving cause beyond cause without end."" The quibble, as before, lies in the word ""difficulty"" -–but here what is it employed to sustain? A First Cause. And what is a First Cause? An ultimate termination of causes. And what is an ultimate termination of causes? Finity -–the Finite. Thus the one quibble, in two processes, by God knows how many philosophers, is made to support now Finity and now Infinity -–could it not be brought to support something besides? As for the quibblers -–they, at least, are insupportable. But -–to dismiss them: -–what they prove in the one case is the identical nothing which they demonstrate in the other.

Of course, no one will suppose that I here contend for the absolute impossibility of that which we attempt to convey in the word ""Infinity."" My purpose is but to show the folly of endeavoring to prove Infinity itself, or even our conception of it, by any such blundering ratiocination as that which is ordinarily employed.

Nevertheless, as an individual, I may be permitted to say that I cannot conceive Infinity, and am convinced that no human being can. A mind not thoroughly self-conscious -–not accustomed to the introspective analysis of its own operations -–will, it is true, often deceive itself by supposing that it has entertained the conception of which we speak. In the effort to entertain it, we proceed step beyond step -–we fancy point still beyond point; and so long as we Continue the effort, it may be said, in fact, that we are tending to the formation of the idea designed; while the strength of the impression that we actually form or have formed it, is in the ratio of the period during which we keep up the mental endeavor. But it is in the act of discontinuing the endeavor -–of fulfilling (as we think) the idea -–of putting the finishing stroke (as we suppose) to the conception -–that we overthrow at once the whole fabric of our fancy by resting upon some one ultimate and therefore definite point. This fact, however, we fail to perceive, on account of the absolute coincidence, in time, between the settling down upon the ultimate point and the act of cessation in thinking. -–In attempting, on the other hand, to frame the idea of a limited space, we merely converse the processes which involve the impossibility.

We believe in a God. We may or may not believe in finite or in infinite space; but our belief, in such cases, is more properly designated as faith, and is a matter quite distinct from that belief proper -–from that intellectual belief -–which presupposes the mental conception.

The fact is, that, upon the enunciation of any one of that class of terms to which ""Infinity"" belongs -–the class representing thoughts of thought -–he who has a right to say that he thinks at all, feels himself called upon, not to entertain a conception, but simply to direct his mental vision toward some given point, in the intellectual firmament, where lies a nebula never to be resolved. To solve it, indeed, he makes no effort; for with a rapid instinct he comprehends, not only the impossibility, but, as regards all human purposes, the inessentiality, of its solution. He perceives that the Deity has not designed it to be solved. He sees, at once, that it lies out of the brain of man, and even how, if not exactly why, it lies out of it. There are people, I am aware, who, busying themselves in attempts at the unattainable, acquire very easily, by dint of the jargon they emit, among those thinkers-that-they-think with whom darkness and depth are synonymous, a kind of cuttle-fish reputation for profundity; but the finest quality of Thought is its self-cognizance; and, with some little equivocation, it may be said that no fog of the mind can well be greater than that which, extending to the very boundaries of the mental domain, shuts out even these boundaries themselves from comprehension.

It will now be understood that, in using the phrase, ""Infinity of Space,"" I make no call upon the reader to entertain the impossible conception of an absolute infinity. I refer simply to the ""utmost conceivable expanse"" of space -–a shadowy and fluctuating domain, now shrinking, now swelling, in accordance with the vacillating energies of the imagination.

Hitherto, the Universe of stars has always been considered as coincident with the Universe proper, as I have defined it in the commencement of this Discourse. It has been always either directly or indirectly assumed -–at least since the dawn of intelligible Astronomy -–that, were it possible for us to attain any given point in space, we should still find, on all sides of us, an interminable succession of stars. This was the untenable idea of Pascal when making perhaps the most successful attempt ever made, at periphrasing the conception for which we struggle in the word ""Universe."" ""It is a sphere,"" he says, ""of which the centre is everywhere, the circumference, nowhere."" But although this intended definition is, in fact, no definition of the Universe of stars, we may accept it, with some mental reservation, as a definition (rigorous enough for all practical purposes) of the Universe proper -–that is to say, of the Universe of space. This latter, then, let us regard as ""a sphere of which the centre is everywhere, the circumference nowhere."" In fact, while we find it impossible to fancy an end to space, we have no difficulty in picturing to ourselves any one of an infinity of beginnings.

As our starting point, then, let us adopt the Godhead. Of this Godhead, in itself, he alone is not imbecile -–he alone is not impious who propounds -–nothing. ""Nous ne connaissons rien,"" says the Baron de Bielfeld -–""Nous ne connaissons rien de la nature ou de l'essence de Dieu: -–pour savoir ce qu'il est, il faut etre Dieu meme."" -–""We know absolutely nothing of the nature or essence of God: -- in order to comprehend what he is, we should have to be God ourselves.""

""We should have to be God ourselves!"" -–With a phrase so startling as this yet ringing in my ears, I nevertheless venture to demand if this our present ignorance of the Deity is an ignorance to which the soul is everlastingly condemned.

By Him, however -–now, at least, the Incomprehensible -–by Him -- assuming him as Spirit -–that is to say, as not Matter -–a distinction which, for all intelligible purposes, will stand well instead of a definition -–by Him, then, existing as Spirit, let us content ourselves, to-night, with supposing to have been created, or made out of Nothing, by dint of his Volition -–at some point of Space which we will take as a centre -–at some period into which we do not pretend to inquire, but at all events immensely remote -–by Him, then again, let us suppose to have been created -–what? This is a vitally momentous epoch in our considerations. What is it that we are justified -–that alone we are justified in supposing to have been, primarily and solely, created?

We have attained a point where only Intuition can aid us: -–but now let me recur to the idea which I have already suggested as that alone which we can properly entertain of intuition. It is but the conviction arising from those inductions or deductions of which the processes are so shadowy as to escape our consciousness, elude our reason, or defy our capacity of expression. With this understanding, I now assert -–that an intuition altogether irresistible, although inexpressible, forces me to the conclusion that what God originally created -–that that Matter which, by dint of his Volition, he first made from his Spirit, or from Nihility, Could have been nothing but Matter in its utmost conceivable state of -- what? -–of Simplicity?

This will be found the sole absolute assumption of my Discourse. I use the word ""assumption"" in its ordinary sense; yet I maintain that even this my primary proposition, is very, very far indeed, from being really a mere assumption. Nothing was ever more certainly -–no human conclusion was ever, in fact, more regularly -–more rigorously de duced: -–but, alas! the processes lie out of the human analysis -–at all events are beyond the utterance of the human tongue.

Let us now endeavor to conceive what Matter must be, when, or if, in its absolute extreme of Simplicity. Here the Reason flies at once to Imparticularity -–to a particle -–to one particle -–a particle of one kind -–of one character -–of one nature -–of one size -–of one form -- a particle, therefore, ""without form and void"" -–a particle positively a particle at all points -–a particle absolutely unique, individual, undivided, and not indivisible only because He who created it, by dint of his Will, can by an infinitely less energetic exercise of the same Will, as a matter of course, divide it.

Oneness, then, is all that I predicate of the originally created Matter; but I propose to show that this Oneness is a principle abundantly sufficient to account for the constitution, the existing phaenomena and the plainly inevitable annihilation of at least the material Universe.

The willing into being the primordial particle, has completed the act, or more properly the Conception, of Creation. We now proceed to the ultimate purpose for which we are to suppose the Particle created -- that is to say, the ultimate purpose so far as our considerations yet enable us to see it -–the constitution of the Universe from it, the Particle.

This constitution has been effected by forcing the originally and therefore normally One into the abnormal condition of Many. An action of this character implies reaction. A diffusion from Unity, under the conditions, involves a tendency to return into Unity -–a tendency ineradicable until satisfied. But on these points I will speak more fully hereafter.

The assumption of absolute Unity in the primordial Particle includes that of infinite divisibility. Let us conceive the Particle, then, to be only not totally exhausted by diffusion into Space. From the one Particle, as a centre, let us suppose to be irradiated spherically -–in all directions -–to immeasurable but still to definite distances in the previously vacant space -–a certain inexpressibly great yet limited number of unimaginably yet not infinitely minute atoms.

Now, of these atoms, thus diffused, or upon diffusion, what conditions are we permitted -–not to assume, but to infer, from consideration as well of their source as of the character of the design apparent in their diffusion? Unity being their source, and difference from Unity the character of the design manifested in their diffusion, we are warranted in supposing this character to be at least generally preserved throughout the design, and to form a portion of the design itself: -–that is to say, we shall be warranted in conceiving continual differences at all points from the uniquity and simplicity of the origin. But, for these reasons, shall we be justified in imagining the atoms heterogeneous, dissimilar, unequal, and inequidistant? More explicitly -–are we to consider no two atoms as, at their diffusion, of the same nature, or of the same form, or of the same size? -–and, after fulfilment of their diffusion into Space, is absolute inequidistance, each from each, to be understood of all of them? In such arrangement, under such conditions, we most easily and immediately comprehend the subsequent most feasible carrying out to completion of any such design as that which I have suggested -–the design of variety out of unity -–diversity out of sameness -- heterogeneity out of homogeneity -–complexity out of simplicity -–in a word, the utmost possible multiplicity of relation out of the emphatically irrelative One. Undoubtedly, therefore, we should be warranted in assuming all that has been mentioned, but for the reflection, first, that supererogation is not presumable of any Divine Act; and, secondly, that the object supposed in view, appears as feasible when some of the conditions in question are dispensed with, in the beginning, as when all are understood immediately to exist. I mean to say that some are involved in the rest, or so instantaneous a consequence of them as to make the distinction inappreciable. Difference of size, for example, will at once be brought about through the tendency of one atom to a second, in preference to a third, on account of particular inequidistance; which is to be comprehended as particular inequidistances between centres of quantity, in neighboring atoms of different form -–a matter not at all interfering with the generally-equable distribution of the atoms. Difference of kind, too, is easily conceived to be merely a result of differences in size and form, taken more or less conjointly: -–in fact, since the Unity of the Particle Proper implies absolute homogeneity, we cannot imagine the atoms, at their diffusion, differing in kind, without imagining, at the same time, a special exercise of the Divine Will, at the emission of each atom, for the purpose of effecting, in each, a change of its essential nature: -–so fantastic an idea is the less to be indulged, as the object proposed is seen to be thoroughly attainable without such minute and elaborate interposition. We perceive, therefore, upon the whole, that it would be supererogatory, and consequently unphilosophical, to predicate of the atoms, in view of their purposes, any thing more than difference of form at their dispersion, with particular inequidistance after it -–all other differences arising at once out of these, in the very first processes of mass-constitution: -–We thus establish the Universe on a purely geometrical basis. Of course, it is by no means necessary to assume absolute difference, even of form, among the atoms irradiated -–any more than absolute particular inequidistance of each from each. We are required to conceive merely that no neighboring atoms are of similar form -–no atoms which can ever approximate, until their inevitable reunition at the end.

Although the immediate and perpetual tendency of the disunited atoms to return into their normal Unity, is implied, as I have said, in their abnormal diffusion; still it is clear that this tendency will be without consequence -–a tendency and no more -–until the diffusive energy, in ceasing to be exerted, shall leave it, the tendency, free to seek its satisfaction. The Divine Act, however, being considered as determinate, and discontinued on fulfilment of the diffusion, we understand, at once, a reaction -–in other words, a satisfiable tendency of the disunited atoms to return into One.

But the diffusive energy being withdrawn, and the reaction having commenced in furtherance of the ultimate design -–that of the utmost possible Relation -–this design is now in danger of being frustrated, in detail, by reason of that very tendency to return which is to effect its accomplishment in general. Multiplicity is the object; but there is nothing to prevent proximate atoms, from lapsing at once, through the now satisfiable tendency -–before the fulfilment of any ends proposed in multiplicity -–into absolute oneness among themselves: -–there is nothing to impede the aggregation of various unique masses, at various points of space: -- in other words, nothing to interfere with the accumulation of various masses, each absolutely One.

For the effectual and thorough completion of the general design, we thus see the necessity for a repulsion of limited capacity -–a separate something which, on withdrawal of the diffusive Volition, shall at the same time allow the approach, and forbid the junction, of the atoms; suffering them infinitely to approximate, while denying them positive contact; in a word, having the power -–up to a certain epoch -–of preventing their Coalition, but no ability to interfere with their Coalescence in any respect or degree. The repulsion, already considered as so peculiarly limited in other regards, must be understood, let me repeat, as having power to prevent absolute coalition, only up to a certain epoch. Unless we are to conceive that the appetite for Unity among the atoms is doomed to be satisfied never; -–unless we are to conceive that what had a beginning is to have no end -–a conception which cannot really be entertained, however much we may talk or dream of entertaining it -- we are forced to conclude that the repulsive influence imagined, will, finally -–under pressure of the Uni-tendency collectively applied, but, never and in no degree until, on fulfilment of the Divine purposes, such collective application shall be naturally made -–yield to a force which, at that ultimate epoch, shall be the superior force precisely to the extent required, and thus permit the universal subsidence into the inevitable, because original and therefore normal, One. -–The conditions here to be reconciled are difficult indeed: -–we cannot even comprehend the possibility of their conciliation; -–nevertheless, the apparent impossibility is brilliantly suggestive.

That the repulsive something actually exists, we see. Man neither employs, nor knows, a force sufficient to bring two atoms into contact. This is but the well-established proposition of the impenetrability of matter. All Experiment proves -–all Philosophy admits it. The design of the repulsion -–the necessity for its existence -–I have endeavored to show; but from all attempt at investigating its nature have religiously abstained; this on account of an intuitive conviction that the principle at issue is strictly spiritual -–lies in a recess impervious to our present understanding -- lies involved in a consideration of what now -–in our human state -–is not to be considered -–in a consideration of Spirit in itself. I feel, in a word, that here the God has interposed, and here only, because here and here only the knot demanded the interposition of the God.

In fact, while the tendency of the diffused atoms to return into Unity, will be recognized, at once, as the principle of the Newtonian Gravity, what I have spoken of as a repulsive influence prescribing limits to the (immediate) satisfaction of the tendency, will be understood as that which we have been in the practice of designating now as heat, now as magnetism, now as electricity; displaying our ignorance of its awful character in the vacillation of the phraseology with which we endeavor to circumscribe it.

Calling it, merely for the moment, electricity, we know that all experimental analysis of electricity has given, as an ultimate result, the principle, or seeming principle, heterogeneity. Only where things differ is electricity apparent; and it is presumable that they never differ where it is not developed at least, if not apparent. Now, this result is in the fullest keeping with that which I have reached unempirically. The design of the repulsive influence I have maintained to be that of preventing immediate Unity among the diffused atoms; and these atoms are represented as different each from each. Difference is their character -–their essentiality -–just as no-difference was the essentiality of their course. When we say, then, that an attempt to bring any two of these atoms together would induce an effort, on the part of the repulsive influence, to prevent the contact we may as well use the strictly convertible sentence that an attempt to bring together any two differences will result in a development of electricity. All existing bodies, of course, are composed of these atoms in proximate contact, and are therefore to be considered as mere assemblages of more or fewer differences; and the resistance made by the repulsive spirit, on bringing together any two such assemblages, would be in the ratio of the two sums of the differences in each: -–an expression which, when reduced, is equivalent to this: -–The amount of electricity developed on the approximation of two bodies, is proportional to the difference between the respective sums of the atoms of which the bodies are composed. That no two bodies are absolutely alike, is a simple corollary from all that has been here said. Electricity, therefore, existing always, is developed whenever any bodies, but manifested only when bodies of appreciable difference, are brought into approximation.

To electricity -–so, for the present, continuing to call it -–we may not be wrong in referring the various physical appearances of light, heat and magnetism; but far less shall we be liable to err in attributing to this strictly spiritual principle the more important phaenomena of vitality, consciousness and Thought. On this topic, however, I need pause here merely to suggest that these phaenomena, whether observed generally or in detail, seem to proceed at least in the ratio of the heterogeneous.

Discarding now the two equivocal terms, ""gravitation"" and ""electricity,"" let us adopt the more definite expressions, ""attraction"" and ""repulsion."" The former is the body; the latter the soul: the one is the material; the other the spiritual, principle of the Universe. No other principles exist. All phaenomena are referable to one, or to the other, or to both combined. So rigorously is this the case -–so thoroughly demonstrable is it that attraction and repulsion are the sole properties through which we perceive the Universe -–in other words, by which Matter is manifested to Mind -–that, for all merely argumentative purposes, we are fully justified in assuming that matter exists only as attraction and repulsion -–that attraction and repulsion are matter: -–there being no conceivable case in which we may not employ the term ""matter"" and the terms ""attraction"" and ""repulsion,"" taken together, as equivalent, and therefore convertible, expressions in Logic.

I said, just now, that what I have described as the tendency of the diffused atoms to return into their original unity, would be understood as the principle of the Newtonian law of gravity: and, in fact, there can be but little difficulty in such an understanding, if we look at the Newtonian gravity in a merely general view, as a force impelling matter to seek matter; that is to say, when we pay no attention to the known modus operandi of the Newtonian force. The general coincidence satisfies us; but, upon looking closely, we see, in detail, much that appears in coincident, and much in regard to which no coincidence, at least, is established. For example; the Newtonian gravity, when we think of it in certain moods, does not seem to be a tendency to oneness at all, but rather a tendency of all bodies in all directions -–a phrase apparently expressive of a tendency to diffusion. Here, then, is an in coincidence. Again; when we reflect on the mathematical LA0 governing the Newtonian tendency, we see clearly that no coincidence has been made good, in respect of the modus operandi, at least, between gravitation as known to exist and that seemingly simple and direct tendency which I have assumed.

In fact, I have attained a point at which it will be advisable to strengthen my position by reversing my processes. So far, we have gone on a priori, from an abstract consideration of Simplicity, as that quality most likely to have characterized the original action of God. Let us now see whether the established facts of the Newtonian Gravitation may not afford us, a posteriori, some legitimate inductions.

What does the Newtonian law declare? -–That all bodies attract each other with forces proportional to their quantities of matter and inversely proportional to the squares of their distances. Purposely, I have here given, in the first place, the vulgar version of the law; and I confess that in this, as in most other vulgar versions of great truths, we find little of a suggestive character. Let us now adopt a more philosophical phraseology: -–Every atom, of every body, attracts every other atom, both of its own and of every other body, with a force which varies inversely as the squares of the distances between the attracting and attracted atom. -–Here, indeed, a flood of suggestion bursts upon the mind.

But let us see distinctly what it was that Newton proved -- according to the grossly irrational definitions of proof prescribed by the metaphysical schools. He was forced to content himself with showing how thoroughly the motions of an imaginary Universe, composed of attracting and attracted atoms obedient to the law he announced, coincide with those of the actually existing Universe so far as it comes under our observation. This was the amount of his demonstration -–that is to say, this was the amount of it, according to the conventional cant of the ""philosophies."" His successes added proof multiplied by proof -–such proof as a sound intellect admits -–but the demonstration of the law itself, persist the metaphysicians, had not been strengthened in any degree. ""Ocular, physical proof,"" however, of attraction, here upon Earth, in accordance with the Newtonian theory, was, at length, much to the satisfaction of some intellectual grovellers, afforded. This proof arose collaterally and incidentally (as nearly all important truths have arisen) out of an attempt to ascertain the mean density of the Earth. In the famous Maskelyne, Cavendish and Bailly experiments for this purpose, the attraction of the mass of a mountain was seen, felt, measured, and found to be mathematically consistent with the immortal theory of the British astronomer.

But in spite of this confirmation of that which needed none -–in spite of the so-called corroboration of the ""theory"" by the so-called ""ocular and physical proof"" -–in spite of the character of this corroboration -–the ideas which even really philosophical men cannot help imbibing of gravity -–and, especially, the ideas of it which ordinary men get and contentedly maintain, are seen to have been derived, for the most part, from a consideration of the principle as they find it developed -–merely in the planet upon which they stand.

Now, to what does so partial a consideration tend -–to what species of error does it give rise? On the Earth we see and feel, only that gravity impels all bodies towards the centre of the Earth. No man in the common walks of life could be made to see or feel anything else -–could be made to perceive that anything, anywhere, has a perpetual, gravitating tendency in any other direction than to the centre of the Earth; yet (with an exception hereafter to be specified) it is a fact that every earthly thing (not to speak now of every heavenly thing) has a tendency not only to the Earth's centre but in every conceivable direction besides.

Now, although the philosophic cannot be said to err with the vulgar in this matter, they nevertheless permit themselves to be influenced, without knowing it, by the sentiment of the vulgar idea. ""Although the Pagan fables are not believed,"" says Bryant, in his very erudite ""Mythology,"" ""yet we forget ourselves continually and make inferences from them as from existing realities."" I mean to assert that the merely sensitive perception of gravity as we experience it on Earth, beguiles mankind into the fancy of Concentralization or especiality respecting it -–has been continually biasing towards this fancy even the mightiest intellects -–perpetually, although imperceptibly, leading them away from the real characteristics of the principle; thus preventing them, up to this date, from ever getting a glimpse of that vital truth which lies in a diametrically opposite direction -–behind the principle's essential characteristics -–those, not of concentralization or especiality -–but of universality and diffusion. This ""vital truth"" is Unity as the source of the phaenomenon.

Let me now repeat the definition of gravity: -–Every atom, of every body, attracts every other atom, both of its own and of every other body, with a force which varies inversely as the squares of the distances of the attracting and attracted atom.

Here let the reader pause with me, for a moment, in contemplation of the miraculous -–of the ineffable -–of the altogether unimaginable complexity of relation involved in the fact that each atom attracts every other atom -–involved merely in this fact of the attraction, without reference to the law or mode in which the attraction is manifested -–involved merely in the fact that each atom attracts every other atom at all, in a wilderness of atoms so numerous that those which go to the composition of a cannon-ball, exceed, probably, in mere point of number, all the stars which go to the constitution of the Universe.

Had we discovered, simply, that each atom tended to some one favorite point -–to some especially attractive atom -–we should still have fAllan upon a discovery which, in itself, would have sufficed to overwhelm the mind: -–but what is it that we are actually called upon to comprehend? That each atom attracts -–sympathizes with the most delicate movements of every other atom, and with each and with all at the same time, and forever, and according to a determinate law of which the complexity, even considered by itself solely, is utterly beyond the grasp of the imagination of man. If I propose to ascertain the influence of one mote in a sunbeam upon its neighboring mote, I cannot accomplish my purpose without first counting and weighing all the atoms in the Universe and defining the precise positions of all at one particular moment. If I venture to displace, by even the billionth part of an inch, the microscopical speck of dust which lies now upon the point of my finger, what is the character of that act upon which I have adventured? I have done a deed which shakes the Moon in her path, which causes the Sun to be no longer the Sun, and which alters forever the destiny of the multitudinous myriads of stars that roll and glow in the majestic presence of their Creator.

These ideas -–conceptions such as these -–unthought-like thoughts -- soul-reveries rather than conclusions or even considerations of the intellect: -–ideas, I repeat, such as these, are such as we can alone hope profitably to entertain in any effort at grasping the great principle, Attraction.

But now, -–with such ideas -–with such a vision of the marvellous complexity of Attraction fairly in his mind -–let any person competent of thought on such topics as these, set himself to the task of imagining a principle for the phaenomena observed -–a condition from which they sprang.

Does not so evident a brotherhood among the atoms point to a common parentage? Does not a sympathy so omniprevalent, so ineradicable, and so thoroughly irrespective, suggest a common paternity as its source? Does not one extreme impel the reason to the other? Does not the infinitude of division refer to the utterness of individuality? Does not the entireness of the complex hint at the perfection of the simple? It is not that the atoms, as we see them, are divided or that they are complex in their relations -–but that they are inconceivably divided and unutterably complex: -–it is the extremeness of the conditions to which I now allude, rather than to the conditions themselves. In a word, not because the atoms were, at some remote epoch of time, even more than together -–is it not because originally, and therefore normally, they were One -–that now, in all circumstances -–at all points -–in all directions -–by all modes of approach -–in all relations and through all conditions -–they struggle back to this absolutely, this irrelatively, this unconditionally one?

Some person may here demand: -–""Why -–since it is to the One that the atoms struggle back -–do we not find and define Attraction 'a merely general tendency to a centre?' -–why, in especial, do not your atoms -–the atoms which you describe as having been irradiated from a centre -–proceed at once, rectilinearly, back to the central point of their origin?""

I reply that they do; as will be distinctly shown; but that the cause of their so doing is quite irrespective of the centre as such. They all tend rectilinearly towards a centre, because of the sphereicity with which they have been irradiated into space. Each atom, forming one of a generally uniform globe of atoms, finds more atoms in the direction of the centre, of course, than in any other, and in that direction, therefore, is impelled -–but is not thus impelled because the centre is the point of its origin. It is not to any point that the atoms are allied. It is not any locality, either in the concrete or in the abstract, to which I suppose them bound. Nothing like location was conceived as their origin. Their source lies in the principle, Unity. This is their lost parent. This they seek always -–immediately -–in all directions -–wherever it is even partially to be found; thus appeasing, in some measure, the ineradicable tendency, while on the way to its absolute satisfaction in the end. It follows from all this, that any principle which shall be adequate to account for the LA0 or modus operandi, of the attractive force in general, will account for this law in particular: -- that is to say, any principle which will show why the atoms should tend to their general centre of irradiation with forces inversely proportional to the squares of the distances, will be admitted as satisfactorily accounting, at the same time, for the tendency, according to the same law, of these atoms each to each: -–for the tendency to the centre is merely the tendency each to each, and not any tendency to a centre as such. -–Thus it will be seen, also, that the establishment of my propositions would involve no necessity of modification in the terms of the Newtonian definition of Gravity, which declares that each atom attracts each other atom and so forth, and declares this merely; but (always under the supposition that what I propose be, in the end, admitted) it seems clear that some error might occasionally be avoided, in the future processes of Science, were a more ample phraseology adopted: -–for instance: -- ""Each atom tends to every other atom &c. with a force &c.: the general result being a tendency of all, with a similar force, to a general centre.""

The reversal of our processes has thus brought us to an identical result; but, while in the one process intuition was the starting-point, in the other it was the goal. In commencing the former journey I could only say that, with an irresistable intuition, I felt Simplicity to have been the characteristic of the original action of God: -–in ending the latter I can only declare that, with an irresistible intuition, I perceive Unity to have been the source of the observed phaenomena of the Newtonian gra"
18,Evening Star,"'Twas noontide of summer,
               And mid-time of night;
             And stars, in their orbits,
               Shone pale, thro' the light
             Of the brighter, cold moon,
               'Mid planets her slaves,
             Herself in the Heavens,
               Her beam on the waves.
                 I gazed awhile
                 On her cold smile;
             Too cold- too cold for me-
               There pass'd, as a shroud,
               A fleecy cloud,
             And I turned away to thee,
               Proud Evening Star,
               In thy glory afar,
             And dearer thy beam shall be;
               For joy to my heart
               Is the proud part
             Thou bearest in Heaven at night,
               And more I admire
               Thy distant fire,
             Than that colder, lowly light."
19,Fairy-Land,"Dim vales- and shadowy floods-
         And cloudy-looking woods,
         Whose forms we can't discover
         For the tears that drip all over!
         Huge moons there wax and wane-
         Again- again- again-
         Every moment of the night-
         Forever changing places-
         And they put out the star-light
         With the breath from their pale faces.
         About twelve by the moon-dial,
         One more filmy than the rest
         (A kind which, upon trial,
         They have found to be the best)
         Comes down- still down- and down,
         With its centre on the crown
         Of a mountain's eminence,
         While its wide circumference
         In easy drapery falls
         Over hamlets, over halls,
         Wherever they may be-
         O'er the strange woods- o'er the sea-
         Over spirits on the wing-
         Over every drowsy thing-
         And buries them up quite
         In a labyrinth of light-
         And then, how deep!- O, deep!
         Is the passion of their sleep.
         In the morning they arise,
         And their moony covering
         Is soaring in the skies,
         With the tempests as they toss,
         Like- almost anything-
         Or a yellow Albatross.
         They use that moon no more
         For the same end as before-
         Videlicet, a tent-
         Which I think extravagant:
         Its atomies, however,
         Into a shower dissever,
         Of which those butterflies
         Of Earth, who seek the skies,
         And so come down again,

20,For Annie,"Thank Heaven! the crisis-
             The danger is past,
           And the lingering illness
             Is over at last-
           And the fever called ""Living""
             Is conquered at last.

           Sadly, I know
             I am shorn of my strength,
           And no muscle I move
             As I lie at full length-
           But no matter!-I feel
             I am better at length.

           And I rest so composedly,
             Now, in my bed
           That any beholder
             Might fancy me dead-
           Might start at beholding me,
             Thinking me dead.

           The moaning and groaning,
             The sighing and sobbing,
           Are quieted now,
             With that horrible throbbing
           At heart:- ah, that horrible,
             Horrible throbbing!

           The sickness- the nausea-
             The pitiless pain-
           Have ceased, with the fever
             That maddened my brain-
           With the fever called ""Living""
             That burned in my brain.

           And oh! of all tortures
             That torture the worst
           Has abated- the terrible
             Torture of thirst
           For the naphthaline river
             Of Passion accurst:-
           I have drunk of a water
             That quenches all thirst:-

           Of a water that flows,
             With a lullaby sound,
           From a spring but a very few
             Feet under ground-
           From a cavern not very far
             Down under ground.

           And ah! let it never
             Be foolishly said
           That my room it is gloomy
             And narrow my bed;
           For man never slept
             In a different bed-
           And, to sleep, you must slumber
             In just such a bed.

           My tantalized spirit
             Here blandly reposes,
           Forgetting, or never
             Regretting its roses-
           Its old agitations
             Of myrtles and roses:

           For now, while so quietly
             Lying, it fancies
           A holier odor
             About it, of pansies-
           A rosemary odor,
             Commingled with pansies-
           With rue and the beautiful
             Puritan pansies.

           And so it lies happily,
             Bathing in many
           A dream of the truth
             And the beauty of Annie-
           Drowned in a bath
             Of the tresses of Annie.

           She tenderly kissed me,
             She fondly caressed,
           And then I fell gently
             To sleep on her breast-
           Deeply to sleep
             From the heaven of her breast.

           When the light was extinguished,
             She covered me warm,
           And she prayed to the angels
             To keep me from harm-
           To the queen of the angels
             To shield me from harm.

           And I lie so composedly,
             Now, in my bed,
           (Knowing her love)
             That you fancy me dead-
           And I rest so contentedly,
             Now, in my bed,
           (With her love at my breast)
             That you fancy me dead-
           That you shudder to look at me,
             Thinking me dead.

           But my heart it is brighter
             Than all of the many
           Stars in the sky,
             For it sparkles with Annie-
           It glows with the light
             Of the love of my Annie-
           With the thought of the light
             Of the eyes of my Annie."

Had I let them pass me by,
With a dreaming eye!
Let none of earth inherit
That vision of my spirit;
Those thoughts I would control,
As a spell upon his soul:
For that bright hope at last
And that light time have past,
And my worldly rest hath gone
With a sigh as it passed on:
I care not though it perish
With a thought I then did cherish"

25,In the Greenest of our Valleys,"I.
            In the greenest of our valleys,
              By good angels tenanted,
            Once fair and stately palace --
              Radiant palace --reared its head.
            In the monarch Thought's dominion --
              It stood there!
            Never seraph spread a pinion
              Over fabric half so fair.

            Banners yellow, glorious, golden,
              On its roof did float and flow;
            (This --all this --was in the olden
              Time long ago)
            And every gentle air that dallied,
              In that sweet day,
            Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,
              A winged odour went away.

            Wanderers in that happy valley
              Through two luminous windows saw
            Spirits moving musically
              To a lute's well-tuned law,
            Round about a throne, where sitting
              (Porphyrogene!)
            In state his glory well befitting,
              The ruler of the realm was seen.

            And all with pearl and ruby glowing
              Was the fair palace door,
            Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing
              And sparkling evermore,
            A troop of Echoes whose sweet duty
              Was but to sing,
            In voices of surpassing beauty,
              The wit and wisdom of their king.

              Shall dawn upon him, desolate!)
            And, round about his home, the glory
              That blushed and bloomed
            Is but a dim-remembered story

            And travellers now within that valley,
              Through the red-litten windows, see
            Vast forms that move fantastically
              To a discordant melody;
            While, like a rapid ghastly river,
              Through the pale door,
            A hideous throng rush out forever,
              And laugh --but smile no more."
26,In Youth I have Known One,"How often we forget all time, when lone
Admiring Nature's universal throne;
Her woods - her winds - her mountains - the intense
Reply of Hers to Our intelligence!

I.

In youth I have known one with whom the Earth
 In secret communing held - as he with it,
In daylight, and in beauty, from his birth:
 Whose fervid, flickering torch of life was lit
From the sun and stars, whence he had drawn forth
 A passionate light - such for his spirit was fit -
And yet that spirit knew - not in the hour
Of its own fervour - what had o'er it power.

                    II.

Perhaps it may be that my mind is wrought
 To a fever by the moonbeam that hangs o'er,
But I will half believe that wild light fraught
 With more of sovereignty than ancient lore
Hath ever told - or is it of a thought
 The unembodied essence, and no more
That with a quickening spell doth o'er us pass
As dew of the night time, o'er the summer grass?

                    III.

Doth o'er us pass, when as th' expanding eye
 To the loved object - so the tear to the lid
Will start, which lately slept in apathy?
 And yet it need not be - (that object) hid
From us in life - but common - which doth lie
 Each hour before us - but then only bid
With a strange sound, as of a harpstring broken
T' awake us - 'Tis a symbol and a token -

                     IV.

Of what in other worlds shall be - and given
 In beauty by our God, to those alone
Who otherwise would fall from life and Heaven
 Drawn by their heart's passion, and that tone,
That high tone of the spirit which hath striven
 Though not with Faith - with godliness - whose throne
With desperate energy 't hath beaten down;
Wearing its own deep feeling as a crown."

        ""Whose heart-strings are a lute"";
      None sing so wildly well

      Ceasing their hymns, attend the spell
        Of his voice, all mute.

      Tottering above
        In her highest noon,

        (With the rapid Pleiads, even,
        Which were seven,)
        Pauses in Heaven.

      And they say (the starry choir
        And the other listening things)
      That Israfeli's fire
      Is owing to that lyre
        By which he sits and sings-
      The trembling living wire
        Of those unusual strings.

      But the skies that angel trod,
        Where deep thoughts are a duty-
      Where Love's a grown-up God-
        Where the Houri glances are
      Imbued with all the beauty
        Which we worship in a star.

      Therefore thou art not wrong,
        Israfeli, who despisest
      An unimpassioned song;
      To thee the laurels belong,
        Best bard, because the wisest!
      Merrily live, and long!

      The ecstasies above
        With thy burning measures suit-
      Thy grief, thy joy, thy hate, thy love,
        With the fervor of thy lute-
        Well may the stars be mute!

      Yes, Heaven is thine; but this
        Is a world of sweets and sours;
        Our flowers are merely- flowers,
      And the shadow of thy perfect bliss
        Is the sunshine of ours.

      If I could dwell
      Where Israfel
        Hath dwelt, and he where I,
      He might not sing so wildly well
        A mortal melody,
      While a bolder note than this might swell
      From my lyre within the sky."
28,Lenore,"Ah, broken is the golden bowl! the spirit flown forever!
  Let the bell toll!- a saintly soul floats on the Stygian river;
  And, Guy de Vere, hast thou no tear?- weep now or nevermore!
  See! on yon drear and rigid bier low lies thy love, Lenore!
  Come! let the burial rite be read- the funeral song be sung!-
  An anthem for the queenliest dead that ever died so young-
  A dirge for her the doubly dead in that she died so young.

  ""Wretches! ye loved her for her wealth and hated her for her pride,
  And when she fell in feeble health, ye blessed her- that she died!
  How shall the ritual, then, be read?- the requiem how be sung
  By you- by yours, the evil eye,- by yours, the slanderous tongue
  That did to death the innocence that died, and died so young?""

  Peccavimus; but rave not thus! and let a Sabbath song
  Go up to God so solemnly the dead may feel no wrong.
  The sweet Lenore hath ""gone before,"" with Hope, that flew beside,
  Leaving thee wild for the dear child that should have been thy
       bride.
  For her, the fair and debonair, that now so lowly lies,
  The life upon her yellow hair but not within her eyes
  The life still there, upon her hair- the death upon her eyes.

  ""Avaunt! avaunt! from fiends below, the indignant ghost is riven-
  From Hell unto a high estate far up within the Heaven-
  From grief and groan, to a golden throne, beside the King of
       Heaven!
  Let no bell toll, then,- lest her soul, amid its hallowed mirth,
  Should catch the note as it doth float up from the damned Earth!
  And I!- to-night my heart is light!- no dirge will I upraise,
  But waft the angel on her flight with a Paean of old days!"""
29,Romance,"Romance, who loves to nod and sing,
     With drowsy head and folded wing,
     Among the green leaves as they shake
     Far down within some shadowy lake,
     To me a painted paroquet
     Hath been- a most familiar bird-
     Taught me my alphabet to say-
     To lisp my very earliest word
     While in the wild wood I did lie,
     A child- with a most knowing eye.

     Of late, eternal Condor years
     So shake the very Heaven on high
     With tumult as they thunder by,
     I have no time for idle cares
     Through gazing on the unquiet sky.
     And when an hour with calmer wings
     Its down upon my spirit flings-
     That little time with lyre and rhyme
     To while away- forbidden things!
     My heart would feel to be a crime
     Unless it trembled with the strings."
30,Sancta Maria,"Sancta Maria! turn thine eyes -
Upon the sinner's sacrifice,
Of fervent prayer and humble love,
From thy holy throne above.
At morn - at noon - at twilight dim -
Maria! thou hast heard my hymn!
In joy and wo - in good and ill -
Mother of God, be with me still!

When the Hours flew brightly by,
And not a cloud obscured the sky,
My soul, lest it should truant be,
Thy grace did guide to thine and thee;

Now, when storms of Fate o'ercast
Darkly my Present and my Past,
Let my Future radiant shine
With sweet hopes of thee and thine!"
31,Serenade,"So sweet the hour, so calm the time,
   I feel it more than half a crime,
   When Nature sleeps and stars are mute,
   To mar the silence ev'n with lute.
   At rest on ocean's brilliant dyes
   An image of Elysium lies:
   Seven Pleiades entranced in Heaven,
   Form in the deep another seven:
   Endymion nodding from above
   Sees in the sea a second love.
   Within the valleys dim and brown,
   And on the spectral mountain's crown,
   The wearied light is dying down,
   And earth, and stars, and sea, and sky
   Are redolent of sleep, as I
   Am redolent of thee and thine
   Enthralling love, my Adeline.
   But list, O list,- so soft and low
   Thy lover's voice tonight shall flow,
   That, scarce awake, thy soul shall deem
   My words the music of a dream.
   Thus, while no single sound too rude
   Upon thy slumber shall intrude,
   Our thoughts, our souls- O God above!
   In every deed shall mingle, love."
32,Song,"I saw thee on thy bridal day -
When a burning blush came o'er thee,
Though happiness around thee lay,
The world all love before thee:

And in thine eye a kindling light
(Whatever it might be)
Was all on Earth my aching sight
Of Loveliness could see.

That blush, perhaps, was maiden shame -
As such it well may pass -
Though its glow hath raised a fiercer flame
In the breast of him, alas!

Who saw thee on that bridal day,
When that deep blush would come o'er thee,
Though happiness around thee lay,
The world all love before thee."
33,Sonnet - To Science,"Science! true daughter of Old Time thou art!
  Who alterest all things with thy peering eyes.
Why preyest thou thus upon the poet's heart,
  Vulture, whose wings are dull realities?
How should he love thee? or how deem thee wise,
  Who wouldst not leave him in his wandering
To seek for treasure in the jewelled skies,
  Albeit he soared with an undaunted wing?
Hast thou not dragged Diana from her car?
  And driven the Hamadryad from the wood
To seek a shelter in some happier star?
  Hast thou not torn the Naiad from her flood,
The Elfin from the green grass, and from me
The summer dream beneath the tamarind tree?"
34,Sonnet- Silence,"There are some qualities- some incorporate things,
       That have a double life, which thus is made
     A type of that twin entity which springs

     There is a two-fold Silence- sea and shore-
       Body and soul. One dwells in lonely places,
       Newly with grass o'ergrown; some solemn graces,
     Some human memories and tearful lore,
     Render him terrorless: his name's ""No More.""
     He is the corporate Silence: dread him not!
       No power hath he of evil in himself;
     But should some urgent fate (untimely lot!)
       Bring thee to meet his shadow (nameless elf,

     How many scenes of what departed bliss!
       How many thoughts of what entombed hopes!
     How many visions of a maiden that is
       No more- no more upon thy verdant slopes!
     No more! alas, that magical sad sound
       Transforming all! Thy charms shall please no more-
     Thy memory no more! Accursed ground
       Henceforth I hold thy flower-enameled shore,

36,Spirits Of The Dead,"Thy soul shall find itself alone
     'Mid dark thoughts of the grey tombstone;
     Not one, of all the crowd, to pry
     Into thine hour of secrecy.

     Be silent in that solitude,
       Which is not loneliness- for then
     The spirits of the dead, who stood
       In life before thee, are again
     In death around thee, and their will
     Shall overshadow thee; be still.

     The night, though clear, shall frown,
     And the stars shall not look down
     From their high thrones in the Heaven
     With light like hope to mortals given,
     But their red orbs, without beam,
     To thy weariness shall seem
     As a burning and a fever
     Which would cling to thee for ever.

     Now are thoughts thou shalt not banish,
     Now are visions ne'er to vanish;
     From thy spirit shall they pass
     No more, like dewdrop from the grass.

     The breeze, the breath of God, is still,
     And the mist upon the hill
     Shadowy, shadowy, yet unbroken,
     Is a symbol and a token.
     How it hangs upon the trees,
     A mystery of mysteries!"
37,Stanzas,"How often we forget all time, when lone
   Admiring Nature's universal throne;

   Reply of HERS to OUR intelligence! [BYRON, The Island.]

                        I

   In youth have I known one with whom the Earth
   In secret communing held- as he with it,
   In daylight, and in beauty from his birth:
   Whose fervid, flickering torch of life was lit
   From the sun and stars, whence he had drawn forth
   A passionate light- such for his spirit was fit-
   And yet that spirit knew not, in the hour
   Of its own fervor what had o'er it power.


                       II

   Perhaps it may be that my mind is wrought
   To a fever by the moonbeam that hangs o'er,
   But I will half believe that wild light fraught
   With more of sovereignty than ancient lore
   Hath ever told- or is it of a thought
   The unembodied essence, and no more,
   That with a quickening spell doth o'er us pass
   As dew of the night-time o'er the summer grass?

                      III

   Doth o'er us pass, when, as th' expanding eye
   To the loved object- so the tear to the lid
   Will start, which lately slept in apathy?
   And yet it need not be- (that object) hid
   From us in life- but common- which doth lie
   Each hour before us- but then only, bid
   With a strange sound, as of a harp-string broken,
   To awake us- 'Tis a symbol and a token

                      IV

   Of what in other worlds shall be- and given
   In beauty by our God, to those alone
   Who otherwise would fall from life and Heaven
   Drawn by their heart's passion, and that tone,
   That high tone of the spirit which hath striven,
   Tho' not with Faith- with godliness- whose throne
   With desperate energy 't hath beaten down;
   Wearing its own deep feeling as a crown."
38,Tamerlane,"Kind solace in a dying hour!
       Such, father, is not (now) my theme-
     I will not madly deem that power
         Of Earth may shrive me of the sin
         Unearthly pride hath revell'd in-
       I have no time to dote or dream:
     You call it hope- that fire of fire!
     It is but agony of desire:
     If I can hope- Oh God! I can-
       Its fount is holier- more divine-
     I would not call thee fool, old man,
       But such is not a gift of thine.

     Know thou the secret of a spirit
       Bow'd from its wild pride into shame.
     O yearning heart! I did inherit
       Thy withering portion with the fame,
     The searing glory which hath shone
     Amid the jewels of my throne,
     Halo of Hell! and with a pain
     Not Hell shall make me fear again-
     O craving heart, for the lost flowers
     And sunshine of my summer hours!
     The undying voice of that dead time,
     With its interminable chime,
     Rings, in the spirit of a spell,
     Upon thy emptiness- a knell.

     I have not always been as now:
     The fever'd diadem on my brow
       I claim'd and won usurpingly-
     Hath not the same fierce heirdom given
       Rome to the Caesar- this to me?
         The heritage of a kingly mind,
     And a proud spirit which hath striven
         Triumphantly with human kind.

     On mountain soil I first drew life:
       The mists of the Taglay have shed
       Nightly their dews upon my head,
     And, I believe, the winged strife
     And tumult of the headlong air
     Have nestled in my very hair.

     So late from Heaven- that dew- it fell
       (Mid dreams of an unholy night)
     Upon me with the touch of Hell,
       While the red flashing of the light
     From clouds that hung, like banners, o'er,
       Appeared to my half-closing eye
       The pageantry of monarchy,
     And the deep trumpet-thunder's roar
       Came hurriedly upon me, telling
         Of human battle, where my voice,
     My own voice, silly child!- was swelling
         (O! how my spirit would rejoice,
     And leap within me at the cry)
     The battle-cry of Victory!

     The rain came down upon my head
       Unshelter'd- and the heavy wind
       Rendered me mad and deaf and blind.
     It was but man, I thought, who shed
       Laurels upon me: and the rush-
     The torrent of the chilly air
       Gurgled within my ear the crush
     Of empires- with the captive's prayer-
     The hum of suitors- and the tone
     Of flattery 'round a sovereign's throne.

     My passions, from that hapless hour,
       Usurp'd a tyranny which men
     Have deem'd, since I have reach'd to power,
         My innate nature- be it so:
       But father, there liv'd one who, then,
     Then- in my boyhood- when their fire
         Burn'd with a still intenser glow,
     (For passion must, with youth, expire)
       E'en then who knew this iron heart
       In woman's weakness had a part.

     I have no words- alas!- to tell
     The loveliness of loving well!
     Nor would I now attempt to trace
     The more than beauty of a face
     Whose lineaments, upon my mind,
     Are- shadows on th' unstable wind:
     Thus I remember having dwelt
       Some page of early lore upon,
     With loitering eye, till I have felt
     The letters- with their meaning- melt
       To fantasies- with none.

     O, she was worthy of all love!
       Love- as in infancy was mine-
     'Twas such as angel minds above
       Might envy; her young heart the shrine
     On which my every hope and thought
       Were incense- then a goodly gift,
         For they were childish and upright-
     Pure- as her young example taught:
       Why did I leave it, and, adrift,
         Trust to the fire within, for light?

     We grew in age- and love- together,
       Roaming the forest, and the wild;
     My breast her shield in wintry weather-
       And when the friendly sunshine smil'd,
     And she would mark the opening skies,
     I saw no Heaven- but in her eyes.

     Young Love's first lesson is- the heart:
       For 'mid that sunshine, and those smiles,
     When, from our little cares apart,
       And laughing at her girlish wiles,
     I'd throw me on her throbbing breast,
       And pour my spirit out in tears-
     There was no need to speak the rest-
       No need to quiet any fears
     Of her- who ask'd no reason why,
     But turn'd on me her quiet eye!

     Yet more than worthy of the love
     My spirit struggled with, and strove,
     When, on the mountain peak, alone,
     Ambition lent it a new tone-
     I had no being- but in thee:
       The world, and all it did contain
     In the earth- the air- the sea-
       Its joy- its little lot of pain
     That was new pleasure- the ideal,
       Dim vanities of dreams by night-

     And dimmer nothings which were real-
       (Shadows- and a more shadowy light!)
     Parted upon their misty wings,
       And, so, confusedly, became
       Thine image, and- a name- a name!
     Two separate- yet most intimate things.

     I was ambitious- have you known
       The passion, father? You have not:
     A cottager, I mark'd a throne
     Of half the world as all my own,
       And murmur'd at such lowly lot-
     But, just like any other dream,
       Upon the vapour of the dew
     My own had past, did not the beam
       Of beauty which did while it thro'
     The minute- the hour- the day- oppress
     My mind with double loveliness.

     We walk'd together on the crown
     Of a high mountain which look'd down
     Afar from its proud natural towers
       Of rock and forest, on the hills-
     The dwindled hills! begirt with bowers,
       And shouting with a thousand rills.

     I spoke to her of power and pride,
       But mystically- in such guise
     That she might deem it nought beside
       The moment's converse; in her eyes
     I read, perhaps too carelessly-
       A mingled feeling with my own-
     The flush on her bright cheek, to me
       Seem'd to become a queenly throne
     Too well that I should let it be
       Light in the wilderness alone.

     I wrapp'd myself in grandeur then,
       And donn'd a visionary crown-
         Yet it was not that Fantasy
         Had thrown her mantle over me-
     But that, among the rabble- men,
       Lion ambition is chained down-
     And crouches to a keeper's hand-
     Not so in deserts where the grand-
     The wild- the terrible conspire
     With their own breath to fan his fire.

     Look 'round thee now on Samarcand!
       Is not she queen of Earth? her pride
     Above all cities? in her hand
       Their destinies? in all beside
     Of glory which the world hath known
     Stands she not nobly and alone?
     Falling- her veriest stepping-stone
     Shall form the pedestal of a throne-
     And who her sovereign? Timour- he
       Whom the astonished people saw
     Striding o'er empires haughtily
       A diadem'd outlaw!

     O, human love! thou spirit given
     On Earth, of all we hope in Heaven!
     Which fall'st into the soul like rain
     Upon the Siroc-wither'd plain,
     And, failing in thy power to bless,
     But leav'st the heart a wilderness!
     Idea! which bindest life around
     With music of so strange a sound,
     And beauty of so wild a birth-
     Farewell! for I have won the Earth.

     When Hope, the eagle that tower'd, could see
       No cliff beyond him in the sky,
     His pinions were bent droopingly-
       And homeward turn'd his soften'd eye.
     'Twas sunset: when the sun will part
     There comes a sullenness of heart
     To him who still would look upon
     The glory of the summer sun.
     That soul will hate the ev'ning mist,
     So often lovely, and will list
     To the sound of the coming darkness (known
     To those whose spirits hearken) as one
     Who, in a dream of night, would fly
     But cannot from a danger nigh.

     What tho' the moon- the white moon
     Shed all the splendour of her noon,
     Her smile is chilly, and her beam,
     In that time of dreariness, will seem
     (So like you gather in your breath)
     A portrait taken after death.
     And boyhood is a summer sun
     Whose waning is the dreariest one-
     For all we live to know is known,
     And all we seek to keep hath flown-
     Let life, then, as the day-flower, fall
     With the noon-day beauty- which is all.

     I reach'd my home- my home no more
       For all had flown who made it so.
     I pass'd from out its mossy door,
       And, tho' my tread was soft and low,
     A voice came from the threshold stone
     Of one whom I had earlier known-
       O, I defy thee, Hell, to show
       On beds of fire that burn below,
       A humbler heart- a deeper woe.

     Father, I firmly do believe-
       I know- for Death, who comes for me
         From regions of the blest afar,
     Where there is nothing to deceive,
         Hath left his iron gate ajar,
       And rays of truth you cannot see
       Are flashing thro' Eternity-
     I do believe that Eblis hath
     A snare in every human path-
     Else how, when in the holy grove
     I wandered of the idol, Love,
     Who daily scents his snowy wings
     With incense of burnt offerings
     From the most unpolluted things,
     Whose pleasant bowers are yet so riven
     Above with trellis'd rays from Heaven,
     No mote may shun- no tiniest fly-
     The lightning of his eagle eye-
     How was it that Ambition crept,
       Unseen, amid the revels there,
     Till growing bold, he laughed and leapt
       In the tangles of Love's very hair?"
39,The Bells,"I
         Hear the sledges with the bells-
                  Silver bells!
  What a world of merriment their melody foretells!
         How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,
             In the icy air of night!
         While the stars that oversprinkle
         All the heavens, seem to twinkle
            With a crystalline delight;
               Keeping time, time, time,
            In a sort of Runic rhyme,
  To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells
            From the bells, bells, bells, bells,
                  Bells, bells, bells-
  From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.

         Hear the mellow wedding bells,
                  Golden bells!
  What a world of happiness their harmony foretells!
         Through the balmy air of night
         How they ring out their delight!
           From the molten-golden notes,
                  And an in tune,
           What a liquid ditty floats
  To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats
                  On the moon!
         Oh, from out the sounding cells,
  What a gush of euphony voluminously wells!
                  How it swells!
                  How it dwells
           On the Future! how it tells
           Of the rapture that impels
         To the swinging and the ringing
           Of the bells, bells, bells,
         Of the bells, bells, bells,bells,
                  Bells, bells, bells-
  To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!

                       III

         Hear the loud alarum bells-
                  Brazen bells!
  What a tale of terror, now, their turbulency tells!
         In the startled ear of night
       How they scream out their affright!
         Too much horrified to speak,
         They can only shriek, shriek,
                  Out of tune,
  In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,
  In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire,
         Leaping higher, higher, higher,
           With a desperate desire,
         And a resolute endeavor,
         Now- now to sit or never,
       By the side of the pale-faced moon.
          Oh, the bells, bells, bells!
          What a tale their terror tells
                  Of Despair!
        How they clang, and clash, and roar!
        What a horror they outpour
      On the bosom of the palpitating air!
          Yet the ear it fully knows,
                  By the twanging,
                  And the clanging,
          How the danger ebbs and flows:
          Yet the ear distinctly tells,
                  In the jangling,
                  And the wrangling,
          How the danger sinks and swells,
  By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells-
                  Of the bells-
          Of the bells, bells, bells,bells,
                Bells, bells, bells-
     In the clamor and the clangor of the bells!

                       IV

         Hear the tolling of the bells-
                  Iron Bells!
  What a world of solemn thought their monody compels!
         In the silence of the night,
         How we shiver with affright
    At the melancholy menace of their tone!
         For every sound that floats
         From the rust within their throats
                   Is a groan.
         And the people- ah, the people-
         They that dwell up in the steeple,
                  All Alone
         And who, tolling, tolling, tolling,
           In that muffled monotone,
         Feel a glory in so rolling
           On the human heart a stone-
         They are neither man nor woman-
         They are neither brute nor human-
                  They are Ghouls:
           And their king it is who tolls;
           And he rolls, rolls, rolls,
                  Rolls
             A paean from the bells!
         And his merry bosom swells
           With the paean of the bells!
         And he dances, and he yells;
         Keeping time, time, time,
         In a sort of Runic rhyme,
           To the paean of the bells-
                  Of the bells:
         Keeping time, time, time,
         In a sort of Runic rhyme,
           To the throbbing of the bells-
         Of the bells, bells, bells-
           To the sobbing of the bells;
         Keeping time, time, time,
           As he knells, knells, knells,
         In a happy Runic rhyme,
           To the rolling of the bells-
         Of the bells, bells, bells:
           To the tolling of the bells,
         Of the bells, bells, bells, bells-
           Bells, bells, bells-
   To the moaning and the groaning of the bells."
40,The City In The Sea,"Lo! Death has reared himself a throne
     In a strange city lying alone
     Far down within the dim West,
     Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best
     Have gone to their eternal rest.
     There shrines and palaces and towers
     (Time-eaten towers that tremble not!)
     Resemble nothing that is ours.
     Around, by lifting winds forgot,
     Resignedly beneath the sky
     The melancholy waters he.

     No rays from the holy heaven come down
     On the long night-time of that town;
     But light from out the lurid sea
     Streams up the turrets silently-
     Gleams up the pinnacles far and free-
     Up domes- up spires- up kingly halls-
     Up fanes- up Babylon-like walls-
     Up shadowy long-forgotten bowers
     Of sculptured ivy and stone flowers-
     Up many and many a marvellous shrine
     Whose wreathed friezes intertwine
     The viol, the violet, and the vine.
     Resignedly beneath the sky
     The melancholy waters lie.
     So blend the turrets and shadows there
     That all seem pendulous in air,
     While from a proud tower in the town
     Death looks gigantically down.

     There open fanes and gaping graves
     Yawn level with the luminous waves;
     But not the riches there that lie
     In each idol's diamond eye-
     Not the gaily-jewelled dead
     Tempt the waters from their bed;
     For no ripples curl, alas!
     Along that wilderness of glass-
     No swellings tell that winds may be
     Upon some far-off happier sea-
     No heavings hint that winds have been
     On seas less hideously serene.

     But lo, a stir is in the air!
     The wave- there is a movement there!
     As if the towers had thrust aside,
     In slightly sinking, the dull tide-
     As if their tops had feebly given
     A void within the filmy Heaven.
     The waves have now a redder glow-
     The hours are breathing faint and low-
     And when, amid no earthly moans,
     Down, down that town shall settle hence,
     Hell, rising from a thousand thrones,
     Shall do it reverence."
41,The Coliseum,"Type of the antique Rome! Rich reliquary
      Of lofty contemplation left to Time
      By buried centuries of pomp and power!
      At length- at length- after so many days
      Of weary pilgrimage and burning thirst,
      (Thirst for the springs of lore that in thee lie,)
      I kneel, an altered and an humble man,
      Amid thy shadows, and so drink within
      My very soul thy grandeur, gloom, and glory!

      Vastness! and Age! and Memories of Eld!
      Silence! and Desolation! and dim Night!
      I feel ye now- I feel ye in your strength-
      O spells more sure than e'er Judaean king
      Taught in the gardens of Gethsemane!
      O charms more potent than the rapt Chaldee
      Ever drew down from out the quiet stars!

      Here, where a hero fell, a column falls!
      Here, where the mimic eagle glared in gold,
      A midnight vigil holds the swarthy bat!
      Here, where the dames of Rome their gilded hair
      Waved to the wind, now wave the reed and thistle!
      Here, where on golden throne the monarch lolled,
      Glides, spectre-like, unto his marble home,
      Lit by the wan light of the horned moon,
      The swift and silent lizard of the stones!

      But stay! these walls- these ivy-clad arcades-
      These moldering plinths- these sad and blackened shafts-
      These vague entablatures- this crumbling frieze-
      These shattered cornices- this wreck- this ruin-
      These stones- alas! these grey stones- are they all-
      All of the famed, and the colossal left
      By the corrosive Hours to Fate and me?

      ""Not all""- the Echoes answer me- ""not all!
      Prophetic sounds and loud, arise forever
      From us, and from all Ruin, unto the wise,
      As melody from Memnon to the Sun.
      We rule the hearts of mightiest men- we rule
      With a despotic sway all giant minds.
      We are not impotent- we pallid stones.
      Not all our power is gone- not all our fame-
      Not all the magic of our high renown-
      Not all the wonder that encircles us-
      Not all the mysteries that in us lie-
      Not all the memories that hang upon
      And cling around about us as a garment,
      Clothing us in a robe of more than glory."""
42,The Conqueror Worm,"Lo! 'tis a gala night
        Within the lonesome latter years!
      An angel throng, bewinged, bedight
        In veils, and drowned in tears,
      Sit in a theatre, to see
        A play of hopes and fears,
      While the orchestra breathes fitfully
        The music of the spheres.

      Mimes, in the form of God on high,
        Mutter and mumble low,
      And hither and thither fly-
        Mere puppets they, who come and go
      At bidding of vast formless things
        That shift the scenery to and fro,
      Flapping from out their Condor wings
        Invisible Woe!

      That motley drama- oh, be sure
        It shall not be forgot!
      With its Phantom chased for evermore,
        By a crowd that seize it not,
      Through a circle that ever returneth in
        To the self-same spot,
      And much of Madness, and more of Sin,
        And Horror the soul of the plot.

      But see, amid the mimic rout
        A crawling shape intrude!
      A blood-red thing that writhes from out
        The scenic solitude!
      It writhes!- it writhes!- with mortal pangs
        The mimes become its food,
      And seraphs sob at vermin fangs
        In human gore imbued.

      Out- out are the lights- out all!
        And, over each quivering form,
      The curtain, a funeral pall,
        Comes down with the rush of a storm,
      While the angels, all pallid and wan,
        Uprising, unveiling, affirm
      That the play is the tragedy, ""Man,""
        And its hero the Conqueror Worm."
43,The Divine Right Of Kings,"The only king by right divine
Is Ellen King, and were she mine
I'd strive for liberty no more,
But hug the glorious chains I wore.

Her bosom is an ivory throne,
Where tyrant virtue reigns alone ;
No subject vice dare interfere,
To check the power that governs here.

O! would she deign to rule my fate,
I'd worship Kings and kingly state,
And hold this maxim all life long,
The King — my King — can do no wrong."
44,The Forest Reverie,"'Tis said that when
The hands of men
Tamed this primeval wood,
And hoary trees with groans of woe,
Like warriors by an unknown foe,
Were in their strength subdued,
The virgin Earth Gave instant birth
To springs that ne'er did flow
That in the sun Did rivulets run,
And all around rare flowers did blow
The wild rose pale Perfumed the gale
And the queenly lily adown the dale
(Whom the sun and the dew
And the winds did woo),
With the gourd and the grape luxuriant grew.

So when in tears
The love of years
Is wasted like the snow,
And the fine fibrils of its life
By the rude wrong of instant strife
Are broken at a blow
Within the heart
Do springs upstart
Of which it doth now know,
And strange, sweet dreams,
Like silent streams
That from new fountains overflow,
With the earlier tide
Of rivers glide
Deep in the heart whose hope has died--
Quenching the fires its ashes hide,--
Its ashes, whence will spring and grow
Sweet flowers, ere long,
The rare and radiant flowers of song!"
45,The Happiest Day-The Happiest Hour,"The happiest day- the happiest hour
       My sear'd and blighted heart hath known,
     The highest hope of pride and power,
       I feel hath flown.

     Of power! said I? yes! such I ween;
       But they have vanish'd long, alas!
     The visions of my youth have been-
       But let them pass.

     And, pride, what have I now with thee?
       Another brow may even inherit
     The venom thou hast pour'd on me
       Be still, my spirit!

     The happiest day- the happiest hour
       Mine eyes shall see- have ever seen,
     The brightest glance of pride and power,
       I feel- have been:

     But were that hope of pride and power
       Now offer'd with the pain
     Even then I felt- that brightest hour
       I would not live again:

     For on its wing was dark alloy,
       And, as it flutter'd- fell
     An essence- powerful to destroy
       A soul that knew it well."
46,The Haunted Palace,"In the greenest of our valleys
        By good angels tenanted,
      Once a fair and stately palace-
        Radiant palace- reared its head.
      In the monarch Thought's dominion-
        It stood there!
      Never seraph spread a pinion
        Over fabric half so fair!

      Banners yellow, glorious, golden,
        On its roof did float and flow,
      (This- all this- was in the olden
        Time long ago,)
      And every gentle air that dallied,
        In that sweet day,
      Along the ramparts plumed and pallid,
        A winged odor went away.

      Wanderers in that happy valley,
        Through two luminous windows, saw
      Spirits moving musically,
        To a lute's well-tuned law,
      Round about a throne where, sitting
        (Porphyrogene!)
      In state his glory well-befitting,
        The ruler of the realm was seen.

      And all with pearl and ruby glowing
        Was the fair palace door,
      Through which came flowing, flowing, flowing,
        And sparkling evermore,
      A troop of Echoes, whose sweet duty
        Was but to sing,
      In voices of surpassing beauty,
        The wit and wisdom of their king.

      But evil things, in robes of sorrow,
        Assailed the monarch's high estate.
      (Ah, let us mourn!- for never morrow
        Shall dawn upon him desolate!)
      And round about his home the glory
        That blushed and bloomed,
      Is but a dim-remembered story
        Of the old time entombed.

      And travellers, now, within that valley,
        Through the red-litten windows see
      Vast forms, that move fantastically
        To a discordant melody,
      While, like a ghastly rapid river,
        Through the pale door
      A hideous throng rush out forever
        And laugh- but smile no more."
47,The Lake. To--,"In spring of youth it was my lot
      To haunt of the wide world a spot
      The which I could not love the less-
      So lovely was the loneliness
      Of a wild lake, with black rock bound,
      And the tall pines that towered around.

      But when the Night had thrown her pall
      Upon that spot, as upon all,
      And the mystic wind went by
      Murmuring in melody-
      Then- ah then I would awake
      To the terror of the lone lake.

      Yet that terror was not fright,
      But a tremulous delight-
      A feeling not the jewelled mine
      Could teach or bribe me to define-
      Nor Love- although the Love were thine.

      Death was in that poisonous wave,
      And in its gulf a fitting grave
      For him who thence could solace bring
      To his lone imagining-
      Whose solitary soul could make
      An Eden of that dim lake."
48,The Raven,"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
 Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
   While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
  As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
 ""'Tis some visitor,"" I muttered, ""tapping at my chamber door-
               Only this, and nothing more.""

   Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
 And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
   Eagerly I wished the morrow;- vainly I had sought to borrow
   From my books surcease of sorrow- sorrow for the lost Lenore-
 For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore-
               Nameless here for evermore.

   And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
 Thrilled me- filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
   So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,
   ""'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door-
 Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;-
               This it is, and nothing more.""

   Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
 ""Sir,"" said I, ""or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
   But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
   And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
 That I scarce was sure I heard you""- here I opened wide the door;-
               Darkness there, and nothing more.

   Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering,
       fearing,
 Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;
   But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
   And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, ""Lenore!""
 This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, ""Lenore!""-
               Merely this, and nothing more.

   Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
  Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
   ""Surely,"" said I, ""surely that is something at my window lattice:
   Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore-
 Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;-
               'Tis the wind and nothing more.""

   Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and
       flutter,
 In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;
   Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed
       he;
   But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door-
 Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door-
               Perched, and sat, and nothing more.

  Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
 By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore.
  ""Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,"" I said, ""art sure no
       craven,
  Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore-
 Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore!""
               Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore.""

   Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
 Though its answer little meaning- little relevancy bore;
   For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
   Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his chamber door-
 Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
               With such name as ""Nevermore.""

   But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
 That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
   Nothing further then he uttered- not a feather then he fluttered-
   Till I scarcely more than muttered, ""other friends have flown
       before-
 On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.""
               Then the bird said, ""Nevermore.""

    Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
 ""Doubtless,"" said I, ""what it utters is its only stock and store,
    Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
    Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore-
 Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
               Of 'Never- nevermore'.""

   But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,
 Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and
       door;
   Then upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
   Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore-
 What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore
               Meant in croaking ""Nevermore.""

   This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
 To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
   This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
   On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight gloated o'er,
 But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o'er,
               She shall press, ah, nevermore!

   Then methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
 Swung by Seraphim whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.
   ""Wretch,"" I cried, ""thy God hath lent thee- by these angels he
       hath sent thee
   Respite- respite and nepenthe, from thy memories of Lenore!
 Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!""
               Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore.""

   ""Prophet!"" said I, ""thing of evil!- prophet still, if bird or
       devil!-
 Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
   Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted-
   On this home by horror haunted- tell me truly, I implore-
 Is there- is there balm in Gilead?- tell me- tell me, I implore!""
               Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore.""

   ""Prophet!"" said I, ""thing of evil- prophet still, if bird or
       devil!
 By that Heaven that bends above us- by that God we both adore-
   Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
   It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore-
 Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.""
               Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore.""

   ""Be that word our sign in parting, bird or fiend,"" I shrieked,
       upstarting-
 ""Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
   Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
   Leave my loneliness unbroken!- quit the bust above my door!
 Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my
       door!""
              Quoth the Raven, ""Nevermore.""

   And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
 On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
   And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
   And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the
       floor;
 And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
               Shall be lifted- nevermore!"
49,The Sleeper,"At midnight, in the month of June,
     I stand beneath the mystic moon.
     An opiate vapor, dewy, dim,
     Exhales from out her golden rim,
     And, softly dripping, drop by drop,
     Upon the quiet mountain top,
     Steals drowsily and musically
     Into the universal valley.
     The rosemary nods upon the grave;
     The lily lolls upon the wave;
     Wrapping the fog about its breast,
     The ruin molders into rest;
     Looking like Lethe, see! the lake
     A conscious slumber seems to take,
     And would not, for the world, awake.
     All Beauty sleeps!- and lo! where lies
     Irene, with her Destinies!

     O, lady bright! can it be right-
     This window open to the night?
     The wanton airs, from the tree-top,
     Laughingly through the lattice drop-
     The bodiless airs, a wizard rout,
     Flit through thy chamber in and out,
     And wave the curtain canopy
     So fitfully- so fearfully-
     Above the closed and fringed lid
     'Neath which thy slumb'ring soul lies hid,
     That, o'er the floor and down the wall,
     Like ghosts the shadows rise and fall!
     Oh, lady dear, hast thou no fear?
     Why and what art thou dreaming here?
     Sure thou art come O'er far-off seas,
     A wonder to these garden trees!
     Strange is thy pallor! strange thy dress,
     Strange, above all, thy length of tress,
     And this all solemn silentness!

     The lady sleeps! Oh, may her sleep,
     Which is enduring, so be deep!
     Heaven have her in its sacred keep!
     This chamber changed for one more holy,
     This bed for one more melancholy,
     I pray to God that she may lie
     For ever with unopened eye,
     While the pale sheeted ghosts go by!

     My love, she sleeps! Oh, may her sleep
     As it is lasting, so be deep!
     Soft may the worms about her creep!
     Far in the forest, dim and old,
     For her may some tall vault unfold-
     Some vault that oft has flung its black
     And winged panels fluttering back,
     Triumphant, o'er the crested palls,
     Of her grand family funerals-
     Some sepulchre, remote, alone,
     Against whose portal she hath thrown,
     In childhood, many an idle stone-
     Some tomb from out whose sounding door
     She ne'er shall force an echo more,
     Thrilling to think, poor child of sin!
     It was the dead who groaned within."
50,The Valley Of Unrest,"Once it smiled a silent dell
      Where the people did not dwell;
      They had gone unto the wars,
      Trusting to the mild-eyed stars,
      Nightly, from their azure towers,
      To keep watch above the flowers,
      In the midst of which all day
      The red sunlight lazily lay.
      Now each visitor shall confess
      The sad valley's restlessness.
      Nothing there is motionless-
      Nothing save the airs that brood
      Over the magic solitude.
      Ah, by no wind are stirred those trees
      That palpitate like the chill seas
      Around the misty Hebrides!
      Ah, by no wind those clouds are driven
      That rustle through the unquiet Heaven
      Uneasily, from morn till even,
      Over the violets there that lie
      In myriad types of the human eye-
      Over the lilies there that wave
      And weep above a nameless grave!
      They wave:- from out their fragrant tops
      Eternal dews come down in drops.
      They weep:- from off their delicate stems
      Perennial tears descend in gems."
51,To --,"I saw thee on thy bridal day-
     When a burning blush came o'er thee,
   Though happiness around thee lay,
     The world all love before thee:

   And in thine eye a kindling light
     (Whatever it might be)
   Was all on Earth my aching sight
     Of Loveliness could see.

   That blush, perhaps, was maiden shame-
     As such it well may pass-
   Though its glow hath raised a fiercer flame
     In the breast of him, alas!

   Who saw thee on that bridal day,
     When that deep blush would come o'er thee,
   Though happiness around thee lay;
     The world all love before thee."
52,To --,"The bowers whereat, in dreams, I see
       The wantonest singing birds,
     Are lips- and all thy melody
       Of lip-begotten words-

     Thine eyes, in Heaven of heart enshrined,
       Then desolately fall,
     O God! on my funereal mind
       Like starlight on a pall-

    Thy heart- thy heart!- I wake and sigh,
       And sleep to dream till day
     Of the truth that gold can never buy-
       Of the baubles that it may."
53,To --,"Sleep on, sleep on, another hour —
I would not break so calm a sleep,
To wake to sunshine and to show'r,
To smile and weep.

Sleep on, sleep on, like sculptured thing,
Majestic, beautiful art thou;
Sure seraph shields thee with his wing
And fans thy brow —

We would not deem thee child of earth,
For, O, angelic, is thy form!
But, that in heav'n thou had'st thy birth,
Where comes no storm

To mar the bright, the perfect flow'r,
But all is beautiful and still —
And golden sands proclaim the hour
Which brings no ill.

Sleep on, sleep on, some fairy dream
Perchance is woven in thy sleep —
But, O, thy spirit, calm, serene,
Must wake to weep."
54,To -- --,"Not long ago, the writer of these lines,
     In the mad pride of intellectuality,
     Maintained ""the power of words""- denied that ever
     A thought arose within the human brain
     Beyond the utterance of the human tongue:
     And now, as if in mockery of that boast,
     Two words- two foreign soft dissyllables-
     Italian tones, made only to be murmured
     By angels dreaming in the moonlit ""dew
     That hangs like chains of pearl on Hermon hill,""
     Have stirred from out the abysses of his heart,
     Unthought-like thoughts that are the souls of thought,
     Richer, far wilder, far diviner visions
     Than even seraph harper, Israfel,
     (Who has ""the sweetest voice of all God's creatures,"")
     Could hope to utter. And I! my spells are broken.
     The pen falls powerless from my shivering hand.
     With thy dear name as text, though bidden by thee,
     I cannot write- I cannot speak or think-
     Alas, I cannot feel; for 'tis not feeling,
     This standing motionless upon the golden
     Threshold of the wide-open gate of dreams.
     Gazing, entranced, adown the gorgeous vista,
     And thrilling as I see, upon the right,
     Upon the left, and all the way along,
     Amid empurpled vapors, far away
     To where the prospect terminates- thee only."
55,To F--,"Beloved! amid the earnest woes
        That crowd around my earthly path-
      (Drear path, alas! where grows
      Not even one lonely rose)-
        My soul at least a solace hath
      In dreams of thee, and therein knows
      An Eden of bland repose.

      And thus thy memory is to me
        Like some enchanted far-off isle
      In some tumultuous sea-
      Some ocean throbbing far and free
        With storms- but where meanwhile
      Serenest skies continually
      Just o'er that one bright island smile."
56,To F--S S. O--D,"Thou wouldst be loved?- then let thy heart
             From its present pathway part not!
           Being everything which now thou art,
             Be nothing which thou art not.
           So with the world thy gentle ways,
             Thy grace, thy more than beauty,
           Shall be an endless theme of praise,
             And love- a simple duty."
57,To Helen - 1848,"I saw thee once- once only- years ago:
I must not say how many- but not many.
It was a July midnight; and from out
A full-orbed moon, that, like thine own soul, soaring,
Sought a precipitate pathway up through heaven,
There fell a silvery-silken veil of light,
With quietude, and sultriness, and slumber,
Upon the upturned faces of a thousand
Roses that grew in an enchanted garden,
Where no wind dared to stir, unless on tiptoe-
Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses
That gave out, in return for the love-light,
Their odorous souls in an ecstatic death-
Fell on the upturn'd faces of these roses
That smiled and died in this parterre, enchanted
By thee, and by the poetry of thy presence.
Clad all in white, upon a violet bank
I saw thee half reclining; while the moon
Fell on the upturn'd faces of the roses,
And on thine own, upturn'd- alas, in sorrow!

Was it not Fate, that, on this July midnight-
Was it not Fate, (whose name is also Sorrow,)
That bade me pause before that garden-gate,
To breathe the incense of those slumbering roses?
No footstep stirred: the hated world an slept,
Save only thee and me. (Oh, Heaven!- oh, God!
How my heart beats in coupling those two words!)
Save only thee and me. I paused- I looked-
And in an instant all things disappeared.
(Ah, bear in mind this garden was enchanted!)

The pearly lustre of the moon went out:
The mossy banks and the meandering paths,
The happy flowers and the repining trees,
Were seen no more: the very roses' odors
Died in the arms of the adoring airs.
All- all expired save thee- save less than thou:
Save only the divine light in thine eyes-
Save but the soul in thine uplifted eyes.
I saw but them- they were the world to me!
I saw but them- saw only them for hours,
Saw only them until the moon went down.
What wild heart-histories seemed to he enwritten
Upon those crystalline, celestial spheres!
How dark a woe, yet how sublime a hope!
How silently serene a sea of pride!
How daring an ambition; yet how deep-
How fathomless a capacity for love!

But now, at length, dear Dian sank from sight,
Into a western couch of thunder-cloud;
And thou, a ghost, amid the entombing trees
Didst glide away. Only thine eyes remained;
They would not go- they never yet have gone;
Lighting my lonely pathway home that night,
They have not left me (as my hopes have) since;
They follow me- they lead me through the years.
They are my ministers- yet I their slave.
Their office is to illumine and enkindle-
My duty, to be saved by their bright light,
And purified in their electric fire,
And sanctified in their elysian fire.
They fill my soul with Beauty (which is Hope),
And are far up in Heaven- the stars I kneel to
In the sad, silent watches of my night;
While even in the meridian glare of day
I see them still- two sweetly scintillant
Venuses, unextinguished by the sun!"
58,To Helen-1831,"Helen, thy beauty is to me
        Like those Nicean barks of yore,
      That gently, o'er a perfumed sea,
        The weary, wayworn wanderer bore
        To his own native shore.

      On desperate seas long wont to roam,
        Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face,
      Thy Naiad airs have brought me home
        To the glory that was Greece
      And the grandeur that was Rome.

      Lo! in yon brilliant window-niche
        How statue-like I see thee stand,
        The agate lamp within thy hand!
      Ah, Psyche, from the regions which
        Are Holy Land!"
59,To M--,"O! I care not that my earthly lot
       Hath little of Earth in it,
     That years of love have been forgot
       In the fever of a minute:

     I heed not that the desolate
       Are happier, sweet, than I,
     But that you meddle with my fate
       Who am a passer by.

     It is not that my founts of bliss
       Are gushing- strange! with tears-
     Or that the thrill of a single kiss
       Hath palsied many years-

     'Tis not that the flowers of twenty springs
       Which have wither'd as they rose
     Lie dead on my heart-strings
       With the weight of an age of snows.

     Not that the grass- O! may it thrive!
       On my grave is growing or grown-
     But that, while I am dead yet alive
       I cannot be, lady, alone."
60,To M.L.S.,"Of all who hail thy presence as the morning-
    Of all to whom thine absence is the night-
    The blotting utterly from out high heaven
    The sacred sun- of all who, weeping, bless thee
    Hourly for hope- for life- ah! above all,
    For the resurrection of deep-buried faith
    In Truth- in Virtue- in Humanity-
    Of all who, on Despair's unhallowed bed
    Lying down to die, have suddenly arisen
    At thy soft-murmured words, ""Let there be light!""
    At the soft-murmured words that were fulfilled
    In the seraphic glancing of thine eyes-
    Of all who owe thee most- whose gratitude
    Nearest resembles worship- oh, remember
    The truest- the most fervently devoted,
    And think that these weak lines are written by him-
    By him who, as he pens them, thrills to think
    His spirit is communing with an angel's."
61,To My Mother,"Because I feel that, in the Heavens above,
     The angels, whispering to one another,
   Can find, among their burning terms of love,
     None so devotional as that of ""Mother,""
   Therefore by that dear name I long have called you-
     You who are more than mother unto me,
   And fill my heart of hearts, where Death installed you
     In setting my Virginia's spirit free.
   My mother- my own mother, who died early,
     Was but the mother of myself; but you
   Are mother to the one I loved so dearly,
     And thus are dearer than the mother I knew
   By that infinity with which my wife
     Was dearer to my soul than its soul-life."
62,To One Departed,"Seraph! thy memory is to me
Like some enchanted far-off isle
In some tumultuous sea -
Some ocean vexed as it may be
With storms; but where, meanwhile,
Serenest skies continually
Just o'er that one bright island smile.
For 'mid the earnest cares and woes
That crowd around my earthly path,
(Sad path, alas, where grows
Not even one lonely rose!)
My soul at least a solace hath
In dreams of thee; and therein knows
An Eden of bland repose."
63,To One In Paradise,"Thou wast all that to me, love,
        For which my soul did pine-
      A green isle in the sea, love,
        A fountain and a shrine,
      All wreathed with fairy fruits and flowers,
        And all the flowers were mine.

      Ah, dream too bright to last!
        Ah, starry Hope! that didst arise
      But to be overcast!
        A voice from out the Future cries,
      ""On! on!""- but o'er the Past
        (Dim gulf!) my spirit hovering lies
      Mute, motionless, aghast!

      For, alas! alas! me
        The light of Life is o'er!
        ""No more- no more- no more-""
      (Such language holds the solemn sea
        To the sands upon the shore)
      Shall bloom the thunder-blasted tree
        Or the stricken eagle soar!

      And all my days are trances,
        And all my nightly dreams
      Are where thy grey eye glances,
        And where thy footstep gleams-
      In what ethereal dances,
        By what eternal streams."
64,To The River --,"Fair river! in thy bright, clear flow
       Of crystal, wandering water,
     Thou art an emblem of the glow
         Of beauty- the unhidden heart-
         The playful maziness of art
     In old Alberto's daughter;

     But when within thy wave she looks-
       Which glistens then, and trembles-
     Why, then, the prettiest of brooks
       Her worshipper resembles;
     For in his heart, as in thy stream,
       Her image deeply lies-
     His heart which trembles at the beam
       Of her soul-searching eyes."
65,Ulalume,"The skies they were ashen and sober;
     The leaves they were crispéd and sere--
    The leaves they were withering and sere;
  It was night in the lonesome October
    Of my most immemorial year;
  It was hard by the dim lake of Auber,
    In the misty mid region of Weir--
  It was down by the dank tarn of Auber,
     In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.

 Here once, through an alley Titanic,
   Of cypress, I roamed with my Soul--
   Of cypress, with Psyche, my Soul.
 These were days when my heart was volcanic
   As the scoriac rivers that roll--
   As the lavas that restlessly roll
  Their sulphurous currents down Yaanek
   In the ultimate climes of the pole--
 That groan as they roll down Mount Yaanek
   In the realms of the boreal pole.

 Our talk had been serious and sober,
   But our thoughts they were palsied and sere--
   Our memories were treacherous and sere--
 For we knew not the month was October,
   And we marked not the night of the year--
   (Ah, night of all nights in the year!)
 We noted not the dim lake of Auber--
   (Though once we had journeyed down here)--
 We remembered not the dank tarn of Auber,
    Nor the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.

 And now, as the night was senescent
   And star-dials pointed to morn--
   As the star-dials hinted of morn--
 At the end of our path a liquescent
   And nebulous lustre was born,
 Out of which a miraculous crescent
   Arose with a duplicate horn--
 Astarte's bediamonded crescent
   Distinct with its duplicate horn.

 And I said--""She is warmer than Dian:
   She rolls through an ether of sighs--
   She revels in a region of sighs:
 She has seen that the tears are not dry on
   These cheeks, where the worm never dies,
 And has come past the stars of the Lion
   To point us the path to the skies--
   To the Lethean peace of the skies--
 Come up, in despite of the Lion,
   To shine on us with her bright eyes--
 Come up through the lair of the Lion,
   With love in her luminous eyes.""

 But Psyche, uplifting her finger,
   Said--""Sadly this star I mistrust--
   Her pallor I strangely mistrust:--
 Oh, hasten! oh, let us not linger!
   Oh, fly!--let us fly!--for we must.""
 In terror she spoke, letting sink her
   Wings till they trailed in the dust--
 In agony sobbed, letting sink her
   Plumes till they trailed in the dust--
   Till they sorrowfully trailed in the dust.

 I replied--""This is nothing but dreaming:
   Let us on by this tremulous light!
   Let us bathe in this crystalline light!
 Its Sybilic splendor is beaming
   With Hope and in Beauty to-night:--
   See!--it flickers up the sky through the night!
 Ah, we safely may trust to its gleaming,
   And be sure it will lead us aright--
 We safely may trust to a gleaming
   That cannot but guide us aright,
   Since it flickers up to Heaven through the night.""

 Thus I pacified Psyche and kissed her,
   And tempted her out of her gloom--
   And conquered her scruples and gloom:
 And we passed to the end of the vista,
   But were stopped by the door of a tomb--
   By the door of a legended tomb;
 And I said--""What is written, sweet sister,
   On the door of this legended tomb?""
   She replied--""Ulalume--Ulalume--
   'Tis the vault of thy lost Ulalume!""

 Then my heart it grew ashen and sober
   As the leaves that were crispèd and sere--
   As the leaves that were withering and sere,
 And I cried--""It was surely October
   On this very night of last year
   That I journeyed--I journeyed down here--
   That I brought a dread burden down here--
   On this night of all nights in the year,
   Oh, what demon has tempted me here?
 Well I know, now, this dim lake of Auber--
   This misty mid region of Weir--
 Well I know, now, this dank tarn of Auber--
   In the ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir.""

 Said we, then--the two, then--""Ah, can it
   Have been that the woodlandish ghouls--
   The pitiful, the merciful ghouls--
 To bar up our way and to ban it
   From the secret that lies in these wolds--
    From the thing that lies hidden in these wolds--
 Had drawn up the spectre of a planet
   From the limbo of lunary souls--
 This sinfully scintillant planet
   From the Hell of the planetary souls?"""
